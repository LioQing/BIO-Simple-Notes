## Biodiversity
Biodiversity - the wide variety of life forms  
Habitat - the place where an organism lives 

## Classification
Benefits:
- study organisms in a systematic way
- identitfy an organism by matching it with the characteristics of one of the groups
- understand the evolutionary history of the organism
- make predictions

### Groupings 
Kindom -> Phylum -> Class -> Order -> Family -> Genus -> Species  

Species is the basic unit of classification of organisms.  
Organisms of the same species can reproduce fetile offspring.  

### Binominal Nomenclature (Naming)
scientific name = genus name + species name  
genus name: first letter CAPITAL letter  
species name: small letters  
Must be __underlined__ or _italics_  
Example: Human = _Homo sapien_

**Eubacteria**  
refers to bacteria  
Structures:
- Capsule (optional) - the outermost layer
- Cell wall (made of peptidoglycan)
- Cell membrane
- Cytoplasm
- Circular ring of DNA
- Flagellum (some)  

Special Characteristics:
- Unicellular

**Archaebacteria**   
Shapes:
- Rod-shaped
- Shperical-shaped
- Sprial-shaped  

Special Characterisitcs:  
- Many located in extreme environment

**Protista**  
refers to protists  
E.g. Amoeba, Algae, Paramecium  

Special Characteristics:
- Many live in water
- Some plant-like, some animal-like
