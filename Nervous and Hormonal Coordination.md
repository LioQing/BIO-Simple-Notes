## Nervous System

**central nervous system (CNS)**  
- brain
- spinal cord

**peripheral nervous system (PNS)**  
- 12 pairs of cranial nerves
- pair of spinal nerves

**neurones (nerve cells)**

structure:  
- cell body
	- mass of cytoplasm
	- contain a nucleus
	- form grey matter of CNS dur to the presence of nucleus
- nerve fibres
	- cytoplasmic branches extending from the body
	- some can be a metre long
	- form white matter of CNS dur to the presence of myelin sheath
	- types
		- **dendron** (dendron's branches: dendrite)
			- transmit impulse towards cell body
			- receive information from other neurones
		- **axon** (axon terminals: nerve endings)
			- transmit impulse away from cell body
			- send information out to other neurones
	- myelin sheath
		- protects and insulates nerve fibres losing to surrounding medium
		- speeds up transmission of nerve impulses
- nerve
	- a bundle of nerve fibres bound together by a fibrous coat

types:
features | sensory neurone | motor neurones | interneurone
--- | --- | --- | ---
direction of nerve impulse transmission | receptor to CNS | CNS to effector | sensory neurone to motor neurone/between neurone
location of cell body | outside CNS | inside CNS | inside CNS
shape of cell body | oval shape | star shape | no definite shape
relative length of nerve fibres | long dendron & short axon | short dendron & long axon | short dendron & short axon

## Transmission of Nerve Impulses between Neurones  
<img src="images/nervous and hormonal coordination - synapse.png">  

mechanism:  
1. synpatic knob has many vesicles that synthsis, secretion and contain neurotransmitters  
2. nerve impulses stimulates vesicles to release neurotransmitters into synaptic cleft  
3. neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft  
4. they bind to receptor sites on dendron of next neurone to generate a nerve impulse

## Protection of CNS
- bony structure
	- brain is enclosed by cranium of the skull
	- spinal cord is enclosed by vertebral column made of vertebrae
- membranes
	- 3 layers of membranes wrap around brain and spinal cord
	- between the middle and inner membranes filled with CSF
- cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
	- in cavities of brain and central canal of spinal cord
	- resembles plasma but less proteins
	- functions
		- supplies nerve cells with oxygen and mutrients and remove wastes
		- acts as water cushion to absorb shock
		- provides mechanical support to maintain shape of brain and spinal cord

- cerebrum
	- structure
		- hemisphere
			- left and right cerebral hemisphere
			- left control right, right control left
		- cerebral cortex and grey matter
			- outer layer of cerebrum is cerebral cortex
			- cerebral cortex made up of grey matter
			- outer surface is highly folded to increase S.A. for neurones
		- white matter
			- inner part of brain made up of white matter
	- function
		- sensory areas
			- receive impulses from receptors
			- give sensations
		- motor areas
			- send out impulse to effectors
			- produce response
		- association areas
			- interpret information from different sensory areas
			- after integration make decision to produce response
			- control **voluntary actions**
- cerebellum
	- structure
		- highly folded to pack more neurones
		- outer layer made of grey matter
		- inner layer made of white matter
	- function
		- coordinates muscular movement
		- maintain body balance and posture
- medulla oblongata
	- structure
		- outer layer made of white matter
		- inner layer made of grey matter
	- function
		- cranial reflex actions
			- pupil size
			- blinking
			- swallowing
			- salivation
			- vomiting
			- coughing
			- sneezing
		- involuntary actions
			- breathing
			- heart-beat
			- peristalsis
			- constriction and dilation of blood vessels
