## Recombinant DNA Technology  
is the process of isolating a DNA fragment from a donor cell and inserting it into the DNA of another cell  

Process:  
1. Isolating the DNA segment containing the gene of interest and amplify it by PCR
2. Add a restriction enzyme acting as a pair of molecular scissors to cut the gene of interest
3. Isolate a plasmid with the antibiotic resistance gene as selectable marker from a bacterial cell
4. Add the same restriction enzyme to cut open the circular plasmid
5. The 'sticky ends' of the gene of interest and the open plasmid are complementary, they join together by adding the enzyme DNA ligase to form a recombinant plasmid
6. Plasmid acts as te vector to instroduce the recominant DNA into a host cell, forming a recombinant bacterium, they are said to be transformed
7. The transformed bacteria are selected by spreadig the bacteria on sterile nutrient agar plate that contains antibiotic
8. The transformed bacteria are removed to culture in large scale in the sterile nutrient solution of a fermenter

## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PRC)
used to produce numerous copies of a selected DNA segment by DNA polymerase  

process: 
1. DNA denaturation
	- Heat the DNA to ~95 degree Celcius
	- the high temerpature denatures the double-stranded DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds
	- the DNA splits into 2 single-stranded DNA, each as a template
2. Annealing
	- Cool the DNA to ~55 degree Celcius
	- Add 2 different primers to the DNA strands
	- They bind respectively at the opposite ends of these 2 separated strands of DNA
	- The anealling of these 2 primers marks the selected DNA region to be amplified
	- The temperature required is specific to the primer used
3. Extension
	- Raise the temperature to 72 degree Celcius (optimum temperatur)
	- Add a large amount of the 4 types of free deoxyribonucleosides triphosphates (dNTPs)
	- Primer acts as the starting point for DNA synthesis
4. Amplification of DNA
	- DNA is ampified by repeating the 3 steps of PCR
	- Achieved by changing the temperature in the sequence of 95 -> 55 -> 72 degree Celcius
	- The new copies of DNA produced in previous cycle can act as template in the following cycles
	- The number of copies growth exponentially
	- Can be done automatically in thermal cycler
	- within 30 to 40 cycles, millions copies of the DNA produced within few hours

### Application
- DNA fingerprinting (for crime investigation)
- Detection of genetic disorder
	- detect genetic disorder due to chromosomal mutation
	- prenatal diagnosis
- Archaeological study
- Human Genome Porject
- Diagnosis for infectious diseases
