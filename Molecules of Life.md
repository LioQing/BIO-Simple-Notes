## Role of Water
- As a solvent
    - chemical reactions in cells
    - transport nutrients, gases, wastes
- As a reactant
    - photosynthesis
    - hydrolyze food
    - activate enzyme
- As a cooling agent
    - sweating
    - transpiration
- As a supporting agent
    - buoyancy
    - turgidity
- As a lubricant
    - mucus
