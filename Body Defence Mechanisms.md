## Non-specific Defence Mechanisms
first line of defence: prevent entry of pathogens with barriers
second line of defence: eliminate entered pathogens

**physical (mechanical) barriers (first line of defence)**  
- skin
    - **thick and impermeable layer of dead cells** in the epidermis acts to prevent the direct entry of pathogens
    - frequent **shedding of dead skin cells** remove pathogens regularly
- respiratory tract
    - **epithelial cells are closly packed** on the inner wall to prevent direct entry of pathogens
    - **mucus traps pathogens and dust particles** in the nasal cavities, trachea and bronchi
    - **beating action of cilia** moves the mucus with the pathogens up to pharynx to be swallowed or coughed out as sputum
- blood clotting
    - process
        - **blood platelets break up to release an enzyme** to trigger a series of enzymatic reactions
        - fibrinogen is converted to fibrin to form **a network to trap pathogens, blood cells to form a clot**
    - funciton
        - clot plugs the wound the prevent pathogens from entering
        - prevents further bleeding

**chemical barriers (first line of defence)**  
- tear and saliva
    - contain lysozyme kills pathogens on the eye
    - tear wash pathogens away
- sebum
    - contain antiseptic to kill pathogens on skins
- gastric juice
    - contain hydrochloric acid kills or inactivates most pathogens
- vaginal secretions
    - contain acidic substances to inhibit growth of pathogens

**phagocytosis (second line of defence)**  
process:
1. phagocytes pass through capillary wall
2. engulf the pathogens
3. cytoplasm of the phagocyte release lysosomes to digest the pathogen

limitations:
- do not act against certain bacteria
- not effective against viruses as viruses produce inside host cells

**inflammatory responses**  
occurs at the site of injury  

symptoms:
- red
- hot
- swollen
- painful

causes:
- **vasodilation** to increase blood flow **causes red and hot**  
    - more phagocytes can engulf and digest pathogens
    - more oxygen and nutrients to increase metabolic rate to speed up repairing
    - wash away dead cells and toxins
- **increase of permeability of blood capillaries**  
    - increased blood flow and **accumulation of tissue fluid causes swelling**
    - swelling imposes pressure to **cause pain**
    - allow more blood plasma and phagocytes to engulf and digest pathogens

## Specific Defence Mechanisms
**antigen**  
recognized as foreign and trigger immune response  

presents: on wall or external membrane of pathogens  
nature: mostly protein or polysaccharide

**lymphocytes**  
- T cells
    - killer T cells 
        - directly kills pathogens with powerful enzymes
    - helper T cells 
        - stimulate B cells to devide actively and differenciate
        - regulate killer T cells
        - activate macrophages
    - memory T cells
        - respond to the same type of antigen immediately  
- B cells
    - plasma cells
        - antigen binds to receptor sites of B cells to stimulate it to divide and differentiate into plasma cells repeatedly
        - plasma cells produces antibodies to against the pathogens
    - memory B cells
        - activated by the same type of antigen in a very short period of time
    - antibody
        - lysis - attach to antigens on the surface of a pathogens to burst and kill them
        - agglutination - binds pathogens together to form a clump to be engulfed by phagocytes
        - opsomization - attach on pathogens for phagocytes to detect and engulf them easily
        - neutrailization - acts as antitoxins to make toxins harmless
