- testes (sing. testis)
	- produce sperms
	- secrete male sex hormones
- scrotum
	- a sac of skin
	- for holding testes
- sperm-producing tubules (seminiferous tubules)
	- highly coiled for increased S.A. for production of sperms by meiotic cell division
	- between tubules are cells that secret male sex hormones to control secondary sexual characteristics
- fine sperm tubules (vasa efferentia)
	- connects epididymis and sperm-producing tubules
- epididymis
	- single much coiled tube on the surface of testis
	- stores sperms temporarily
- sperm duct (vas deferens)
	- a tube in penis
	- passes semen & urine out of body at different time
- penis
	- made up of erectile tissues with numerous small blood vessels
	- during excitement form, it changes into an erect form for facilitating injection for ejaculation of semen duting sexual intercourse
- seminal vesicles & prostate glands & Cowper's glands
	- secret seminal fluid
	- seminal fluid contains glucose and fructose that nourish & activate sperms
	- seminal fluid provide a fluid medium for sperms to swim in
	- seminal fluid alkaline nature neutralizes acidic condition in vagina of female

- ovaries
	- structure
		- two lie in the abdominal cavity
		- held in position by ligament
	- functions
		- produce eggs or ova by meiotic cell division
		- secrete female sex hormones which control the secondary sexual characteristics
- oviducts (fallopian tubes)
	- structure
		- narrow muscular tube of ~10 cm long
		- upper end is a funnel-shaped opening - oviducal funnel
	- functions
		- cilia sweep the ovum and embryo down to uterus
		- fertilization usually occurs here
- uterus
	- structure
		- a central, muscular sac
		- thick muscular wall
		- inner lining richly supplied with blood vessels
		- muscular ring the cervix guards lower opening
	- functions
		- thich muscular wall protects embryo (foetus) and provide constant internal env. for it to develop
		- forms the placenta fro nutrition, gas exchange and excretion of embryo
		- placenta produces female sex hormones
		- muscular wall contracts to push the foetus through dilated cervix during labour
- vagina
	- structure
		- muscular tube leading from cervix to outside
	- functions
		- receives the penis during sexual intercourse
		- secrets mucus for sperms to swim towards uterus
		- birth canal for foetus to pass out
		- acidic env. reduce bacterial growth  

## Structure of Sperm

- small size
	- enhance its movement to find ova for fertilization
- produced in large numbers
	- to increase chance of fertilization
- tadpole-like provide **streamlined shape** to **reduce resistance**
- structure
	- head
		- a nucleus with **haploid number of chromosomes**
		- cap-like structure **contains enzymes** for penetrating into the ova for fertilization
		- does not contain any food reserve
	- middle piece
		- contains many mitochondria to supply energy for swimming
	- tail
		- produce swimming action

- in form of a sphere with diameter of ~0.1 mm (much bigger than a sperm)  
- cannot move by itself
- produced in much smaller numbers (once per month) than sperm because of their wastage
- structure
	- nucleus
		- contains haploid number of chromosomes
	- cytoplasm
		- large amount of food reserves to support early development of zygote to form an embryo
	- membranes
		- enclose the cell
	- jelly coat (zona pellucida)
		- becomes impenetrable to other sperms after the first sperm entered
	- follicle cells (corona radiata)
		- form a layer of cells around the ovum
