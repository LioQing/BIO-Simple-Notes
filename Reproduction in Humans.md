- testes (sing. testis)
	- produce sperms
	- secrete male sex hormones
- scrotum
	- a sac of skin
	- for holding testes
- sperm-producing tubules (seminiferous tubules)
	- highly coiled for increased S.A. for production of sperms by meiotic cell division
	- between tubules are cells that secret male sex hormones to control secondary sexual characteristics
- fine sperm tubules (vasa efferentia)
	- connects epididymis and sperm-producing tubules
- epididymis
	- single much coiled tube on the surface of testis
	- stores sperms temporarily
- sperm duct (vas deferens)
	- a tube in penis
	- passes semen & urine out of body at different time
- penis
	- made up of erectile tissues with numerous small blood vessels
	- during excitement form, it changes into an erect form for facilitating injection for ejaculation of semen duting sexual intercourse
- seminal vesicles & prostate glands & Cowper's glands
	- secret seminal fluid
	- seminal fluid contains glucose and fructose that nourish & activate sperms
	- seminal fluid provide a fluid medium for sperms to swim in
	- seminal fluid alkaline nature neutralizes acidic condition in vagina of female

- ovaries
	- structure
		- two lie in the abdominal cavity
		- held in position by ligament
	- functions
		- produce eggs or ova by meiotic cell division
		- secrete female sex hormones which control the secondary sexual characteristics
- oviducts (fallopian tubes)
	- structure
		- narrow muscular tube of ~10 cm long
		- upper end is a funnel-shaped opening - oviducal funnel
	- functions
		- cilia sweep the ovum and embryo down to uterus
		- fertilization usually occurs here
- uterus
	- structure
		- a central, muscular sac
		- thick muscular wall
		- inner lining richly supplied with blood vessels
		- muscular ring the cervix guards lower opening
	- functions
		- thich muscular wall protects embryo (foetus) and provide constant internal env. for it to develop
		- forms the placenta fro nutrition, gas exchange and excretion of embryo
		- placenta produces female sex hormones
		- muscular wall contracts to push the foetus through dilated cervix during labour
- vagina
	- structure
		- muscular tube leading from cervix to outside
	- functions
		- receives the penis during sexual intercourse
		- secrets mucus for sperms to swim towards uterus
		- birth canal for foetus to pass out
		- acidic env. reduce bacterial growth

- small size
	- enhance its movement to find ova for fertilization
- produced in large numbers
	- to increase chance of fertilization
- tadpole-like provide **streamlined shape** to **reduce resistance**
- structure
	- head
		- a nucleus with **haploid number of chromosomes**
		- cap-like structure **contains enzymes** for penetrating into the ova for fertilization
		- does not contain any food reserve
	- middle piece
		- contains many mitochondria to supply energy for swimming
	- tail
		- produce swimming action

- in form of a sphere with diameter of ~0.1 mm (much bigger than a sperm)  
- cannot move by itself
- produced in much smaller numbers (once per month) than sperm because of their wastage
- structure
	- nucleus
		- contains haploid number of chromosomes
	- cytoplasm
		- large amount of food reserves to support early development of zygote to form an embryo
	- membranes
		- enclose the cell
	- jelly coat (zona pellucida)
		- becomes impenetrable to other sperms after the first sperm entered
	- follicle cells (corona radiata)
		- form a layer of cells around the ovum

## Puberty
**secondary sexual characteristics**
- male
	- beard on face
	- hairs in armpits and around base of gentital area
	- shoulders broaden and more muscles develop
	- larynx enlarges and voice deepens
- female
	- haris grow in armpits and around gentital area
	- hip broadens and more fat develops
	- breasts develop
	- menstruation starts

**ovulation**  
(generally once every 28 days in one of the two ovaries)
1. follicles inside ovaries starts to develop
2. one follicle will reach maturity and contains an ovum
3. when follicle grow bigger, it moves to the surface of ovary
4. it bursts and release the potential ovum into the funnel of oviduct
5. the ruptured follicle develop into a yellow body  

**menstrual cycle**  
stages:  
1. menstruation (day 1 - 5)
	- first day of menstrual flow is regarded as beginning of menstrual cycle
	- the uterine lining sloughs off
	- about 35 ml of blood together sloughed cells, mucus, and unfertilized ovum
2. uterine lining thickens and ovulation occurs (day 6 - 14)
	- another follicle in the ovary develop
	- follicle secretes a sex hormone, oestrogen, which stimulates uterine lining to thicken
	- at last the follicle bursts to release the ovum, ovulation
3. thickened uterine lining for implantation (day 15 - 28)
	- if implantation succeed
		- the uterine lining continue its thickening and form placenta
		- no menstruation & no ovulation during pregnancy
	- if ovum is not fertilized
		- the ovum will die after 24 hours
		- on 25th day, the yellow body begin to degenerate and stops secreting the female sex hormone, progesterone

factors:  
- length of the cycle varies greatly in different individuals
	- stress
	- emotional disturbance
- menstruation and ovulation stop at about 45 - 55, the period is called menopause

## Copulation
sexual intercourse
1. male is sexually excited
2. erector tissue of penis is filled with large amount of blood
3. penis from normal soft state to hard and erect
4. erect penis is inserted into the vagina of the female (**copulation/sexual intercourse**)
5. the muscular contraction of epididymis and sperm duct forces semen through penis to the vagina (**ejaculation**)

## Fertilization
movement of sperms:
1. sperms use their tails to swim from vagina through cervix and uterus to oviduct
2. their movement is also assisted by the muscular contraction of uterus and oviduct
3. many sperms die on the way, and the remains alive from 1 to 3 days in female reproductive tract

process of fertilization:  
1. enzymes from the head of sperms dissolve follicle cells and jelly coat of ovum
2. sperm enters the cytoplasm of the ovum
3. sperm nucleus fuses with ovum nucleus to form zygote (**fertilization**)
4. once a sperm has entered the ovum, the jelly coat become impenetratable
	- to ensure only 1 sperm fertilized the ovum

significance:   
- forms zygote to develop into a new individual
- combination of gene from both parent increase genetic variation
- restore diploid number of chromosomes to maintain constant nubmer of chromosomes of the speices

## Development of Embryo & Foetus

**implantation**  
1. movement of zygote
	- through oviduct, the fertilized ovum move to uterus
	- it divide rapidly by mitotic cell division to form embryo
2. the embryo embeds into the uterine lining (**implantation**)
	- in humans, its called conception that marks beginning of pregnancy

**amnion**  
as embryo develop, it is enclosed by a membrane called amnion that secrets **amniotic fluid** inside  

significance
- keep embryo moist prevent desiccation
- acts as water cushion protect against mechanical injury
- allows embryo have degree of movement as it grows
- reduces temperature changes to provide stable environment
- lubricates vagina during birth of the foetus

**placenta**  
structure:  
- villi
	- **increase S.A. to promote exchange of materials** between foetal & maternal blood
	- capillary wall is **extremely thin to provide short distance** to facilitate rate of diffusion
- umbilical cord
	- **umbilical arties** carry **deoxygenated blood & wastes from foetus** to placenta
	- **umbilical vein** carry **oxygenated blood & nutrients & antivodies from placenta** to foetus
- separation of maternal & foetal blood
	- acts as a barrier to **prevent maternal hormones & other harmful substances** to the foetus
	- **prevents high blood pressure of maternal blood** breaking foetal blodd vessels
	- prevents clotting of maternal and foetal blood when their blood groups are incompatible
- ultrasound screening
	- ultralsound creats picture of foetus
	- sound waves sent to the mothers belly reflects back
	- for determining foetus growth, position, abnormalities, number

function:  
- exchange of materials
	- for dissolved oxygen, nutrients, antibodies diffuse from maternal blood to foetal blood
	- dissolved CO2 & metabolic wastes diffuse from foetal blood to maternal blood
- hormonal secretion
	- placental produce female sex hormone to maintain thickness of uterine lining during pregnancy
	- the female sex hormone also prevent ovulation & menstruation
	- it also secrets Human Chorionic Hormone (HCG) to maintain thickness of uterie lining & prevent menstruation
	- the precense of HCG can be used in pregnancy test
- protection
	- allows maternal antibodies into the foetus, providing passive immunity
	- placenta acts as barrier to prevent harmful substances from maternal to foetal blood

## Harmful Activities to Foetus by Pregnant Woman
- tobaco smoking
	- nicotine
		- causes constriction of blood vessels => lower rate of material exchange
		- stimulates cardiac muscles => foetus' heart beat may too fast
	- carbon monoxide
		- binds to mother's haemoglobin => reduce oxygen-carrying capacity => cannot exchange to foetus => may have underweight baby
	- effects
		- prenatal mortality
		- pre-term delivery
		- lighter in weight
		- respiratory disease
		- foetus born prematurely
- drinking
	- alcohol diffuses to feotal blood through placenta
	- effects
		- foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
		- mental retardation
		- reduced growht
		- poor muscle tone
		- heart defects
		- abnormal limb development
		- facial characteristics
		- behavioural problems
	
## Twins
- identical twins
	- same genetic make-up
	- same sex
	- similar character
	- formed from 1 ovum
- fraternal twins (non-identical twins)
	- different genotype
	- may be different sex and characters
	- formed from 2 ova

## Birth Process
1. gestation period
	1. foetus head points downwards
2. labour
	1. dilation of cervix
	2. expulsion of foetus
	3. shedding of placenta
3. navel
	1. umbilical cord dried up and falls off, forming navel

## Parental Care

- clothing
- shelter
- educaiton
- **breast-feeding**  

advantages of breast-feeding: 
- benefits to baby
	- better food (natural & essential)
	- antibodies
	- sense of security
- benefits to mother
	- faster body recovery
	- reduce risk of certain cancer
	- economic advantages

disadvantages of breast-feeding:  
- less convenient than bottle feeding

- some women are unsuitable

## Birth Control
- preventing sperms from meeting the ovum
	- rhythm method
	- barrier methods
		- condom
		- diaphragm
	- surgical method - sterilization
		- vasectomy
		- tubal ligation
- preventing ovulation - hormonal methods
	- contraceptive pills
	- contraceptive patches
