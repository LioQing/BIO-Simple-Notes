## Nutrition
plants are **autotrophs**  
def: produce complex organic food from simple inorganic substances from the environment on their own  

## Roots

functions:  
- absorb water and minerals from soil
- anchor the plant in soil for it to stand erect to compete for sunlight

structures:  
- root cap
	- protects the growing point when it grows
- region of cell division (growing point)
	- cells actively divide by mitotic cell division to produce new cells
- region of elongation
	- absorb water
	- elongate greatly to increase length
- region of differentitation
	- cells specialised into tissues
	- epidermal cells give out root hairs to increase S.A. for absorbing water and mineral salts
	- vascular bundles - xylem, phloem
	- etc.

## Transverse Section of a Dicotyledonous Root
<img src="https://github.com/LioQing/BIO-Simple-Notes/blob/master/images/process%20in%20plants%20-%20section%20of%20root.png">  

- epidermis
	- layer of thin-walled cell
	- protect inner tissues against mechanical damage, infection, fungal invasion
	- hair
		- root hair (single cell) to increase S.A. for absorbing water and mineral salts
		- stem hair (milticellular) to decrease water loss
	- cuticle
		- in root no cuticle to increase the absorption rate
		- in stem covered by a waxy cuticle to decrease water loss
- cortex
	- many layers of large, thin-walled cells, many intercellular spaces between
	- stores starch
	- in root
		- permits movement of water and mineral salt
	- in stem
		- outer, middle, inner cortex
		- gives turgid support
		- carry out photosynthesis
- stele
	- vascular bundles
		- xylem
		- phloem
		- cambium
	- pith
		- large thin-layered cells
		- center of stele
		- store starch

Xylem and Phloem
- xylem
	- hollow and long
	- dead (no nucleus or cytoplasm)
		- least resistance to transport water and mineral salts
	- thick wall contains lignin
		- mechanical support to root
- phloem
	- living sieve tubes - elongated cells with end walls and pores
	- contain cytoplasm but no nucleus
		- permit the translocation of organic food through stems to the growing point, storage organs, fruits
	- companion cells
		- help sieve tubes to transport food

## Absorption of Water in Root
1. water from soil into root hair
	- water potential ψ root hairs < ψ soil
	- by osmosis, water moves from soild through differentially permeable cell membrane into root hairs
2. transverse movement of water across root
	- ψ root hairs > ψ neighbouring cortical cells
	- by osmosis, water moves from root hair to cortical cell, then finally xylem

## Stomata
features:  
- small pores in the epidermis of leaf
- each stoma is surrounded by a pair of guard cell
	- kidney-shaped
	- inner wall is thicker and less elastic than outer wall
	- has chloroplasts (epidermal cells do not)  

mechanism:  
key: ([ opening ]/[ closing ])
1. under (sunlight (increase in sugar conc.)/darkness)
2. ψ (decrease/N.A.)
3. guard cells (absorb water by osmosis from surrounding cells/N.A.)
4. guard cells become (turgid/flaccid)
5. guard cells (curve apart/become less curved)
6. stoma (opens/closes)

distributions:  
- monocots
	- leaves vertically held -> both sides equally illuminated
	- both surfaces have roughly equal number of stomata
	- dull colour flower
- dicots
	- leaves horizontally held -> upper epidermis directly illuminated
	- less stomata on upper surface -> reduce water loss
	- more stomata on bottom epidermis
	- more attractive flower colour
- floating leaves
	- stomata on upper epidermis only -> permit absorption of gas from air
	- no stomata on lower epidermis
- submerged leaves
	- no cuticle on both surfaces permit gases exchange over all surfaces
	- no stomata on both sides

## Transpiration
(evaporation in plant)  

**transpiration pull**  
1. under sunlight mesophyll cells of plant lose water by **evaporation** -> ψ mesophyll cells decrease
2. process repeated and water is drwan from xylem
3. the withdrawal produces tension in the water column in xylem
4. **transpiration pull** is the pulling force to pull water from root through xylem to leaves
5. transpiration stream is the flow of water

physical factors:  
- humidity -> low -> high rate of transpiration
	- water vapour gradient
- temperature -> high -> high rate of transpiration
	- high rate of evaporation
	- high rate of diffusion
- light intensity -> high -> high rate of transpiration
	- temperature increase
- wind
	- gentle wind -> high rate of transpiration
	- strong wind -> low rate of transpiration
		- cooling effect -> low evaporation
		- excess water loss -> stomata close
- water supply -> low -> low rate of transpiration
	- stomata close

## Expt.
precaution:
- cut leafy shoot underwater -> prevent air from entering xylem
- smear all conection of apparatus with vaseline to make it air tight
- let plant to equilibrate -> adapt to the env.
- make buble small -> too long will split into 2
- thin layer of oil on water surface -> no evaporation
