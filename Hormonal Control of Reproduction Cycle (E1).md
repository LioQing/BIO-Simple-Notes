## Sex Hormones in Menstrual Cycle
- **follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)**
	- from pituitary gland
	- acts on ovary to stimulate follicle development
	- stimulates secretion of oestrogen from follicle
- **luteinizing hormone (LH)**
	- from pituitary gland
	- triggers ovulation
	- stimulates yellow body development from ruptured follicle
	- stimulates yellow body to secret oestrogen & progesterone
- **oestrogen**
	- from ovary (follicle and yellow body)
	- stimulates uterine lining to thicken
	- **alone at low level** inhibits pituitary glands to secret FSH & LH
	- **alone at high level** stimulate pituitary glands to secret FSH & LH
	- **with progesterone** inhibits pituitary glands to secret FSH & LH
- **progesterone**
	- from ovary (yellow body)
	- maintain the thickness of uterine lining
	- **with oestrogen** inhibits pituitary glands to secret FSH & LH

before ovulation (follicular phase)  
1. FSH
	1. thickened uterine lining breaks down and **menstruation** occurs  
	2. pituitary gland starts to secret more FSH  
	3. FSH stimulate the follicles development, one will mature
	4. FSH stimulate the follicles to secret oestrogen  
2. oestrogen
	1. oestrogen causes uterine lining to thicken
	2. inhibits further secretion of FSH from pituitary glands (-ve feedback)
	3. level oestrogen rises and reaches a peak, this stimulates large amount of FSH and LH to be suddenly secreted from pituitary glands
3. FSH & LH
	1. high level of FSH & LH triggers **ovulation**  

after ovulation (luteal phase)  
1. LH
	1. high level of LH stimulates the ruptured follicle to develop into a **yellow body**
	2. high level of LH stimulates the secretion of progesterone and oestrogen from yellow body
2. progesterone & oestrogen
	1. progesterone & oestrogen together maintain and promotes thickening of uterine lining for ready for implantation
	2. high level of progesterone & oestrogen inhibits further secretion of FSH & LH from pituitary glands so no follicles are developed

if **no fetilization** occurs
1. low level of LH & FSH causes **yellow body to degenerate**
2. denegeration of yellow body stop secretion of progesterone & oestrogen
3. effects of progesterone & oestrogen stop
	- thickened uterine lining starts to break down
	- no inhibition on the secretion of FSH & LH from pituitary
4. new menstrual cycle begins

if **successful fertilization** occurs
1. fertilized ovum (zygote) divide to form embryo and **implants** into the uterine lining
2. **human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)**
	1. functions like LH to prevent degeneration of yellow body to maintain secretion of progesterone & oestrogen
	2. high level of progesterone inhibits secretion of FSH from pituitary gland for further follicles development
	
## Uses of Sex Hormones
- contraceptive pills
	- contains synthetic progesterone (and maybe also oestrogen)
	- prevent secretion of FSH & LH to develop follicle & ovulation
- emergency contraceptive pills
	- contains high dose of syntehtic progesterone (and maybe also oestrogen)
	- prevents ovulations & implantation of embryo  

## Infertility
causes:  
- male
	- low sperm counts
	- low sperm mobility
	- sperms have defects
	- blockage of sperm ducts
- female
	- ova fail to develop & mature
	- ova fail to be released from ovary
	- uterine lining does not thicken
	- blockage of oviducts

treatment:
- hormones  

cause | hormone | effect
--- | --- | ---
ova fail to develop & mature | synthetic FSH | stimulates follicle development
ova fail to be released | synthetic LH | stimulates ovulation
uterine lining does not thicken | synthetic progesterone (and oestrogen) (taken after ovulation) | stimulates the thickening and maintain the thickness of uterine lining

- **in vitro fertilization (IVF)**
	- FSH is given to stimulate several follicles to be developed
	- ova are removed from the female body and cultured
	- semen of donor is also put into the culture medium
	- fertilized ova developed and embryo is formed
	- embryo is transferred back into the female body
	- may results in multiple births
