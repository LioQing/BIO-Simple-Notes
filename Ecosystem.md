## Ecology
def: the study of the interaction between organisms and their environment  

levels of organization:
1. Species
	- a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring
	- with similar characteristics
2. Population
	- the size of a group of organisms of the same species living together in the same habitat
	- **habitat** is the place where an organism lives with particular set of **abiotic factors**
3. Community
	- includes all the populations of different species living together in the same habitat
4. Ecosystem
	- natural unit of environment
	- consists of biotic community of plants and animals interacting with each other
	- the **abiotic factors** form a stable and self-supporting system
5. Biomes
	- major division of biotic communities that occupy big geographical area
	- defined mainly by dominant vegetation
	- characterised by adaptation of the organisms to the major climate of that environment
6. Biosphere
	- is all the life-supporting space of land, air, water surrounding the earth
	- includes all ecosystems on earth

## Ecosystems in Hong Kong

- Rocky shores
- Mangroves
- Freshwater streams
- Woodlands
- Grasslands

## Components of an Ecosystem

- abiotic factors (physical factors)
- biotic community

### Abiotic Factors
- temperature
	- enzyme activities
	- organisms' ability of regulating body temperature
		- poikilotherms (cold-blooded animals)
		- homoiotherms (warm-blooded animals)
- light intensity
- rainfall and humidity
- wind
- soil
- oxygen conc.
- salinity

### Biotic Factors
terms: 
- habitat
	- the place where an organism lives
- niche
	- sum total of way of life of a species in its environment
	- its roles and activities (interactions within community and other abiotic factors)
- species diversity and dominant species

relationship between organisms: 
relationship | species A | species B | explanation
--- | --- | --- | ---
predation | + | - | A kills and feeds on B
competition | - | - | A & B compete for resources
commensalism | + | 0 | A live near/on/in B to get resources but does not harm B from doing it
mutualism | + | + | A & B benefit each other when near/together
parasitism | + | - | A lives in/on B and gets nutrients from B

**ecological succession**: 
- general pattern
	- earlier plants enrich, thicken, increase fertility of soil
	- later plants over-shaddow & eliminate earlier plants to become dominant plant
- primary succession
	- occurs on previously lifeless, uncolonized place
	- the land is lack of soil and vegetation
	- starts with pioneer community
	- longer time to reach climax community
- secondary succession
	- the restoration of pre-existing community
	- the land already has life present which was later destroyed
	- seeds, roots, underground vegetative organs of plant may still survive in soil
	- shorter time to reach climax community

stages of **primary succession**:
1. lichens community (pioneer community)
	- acid secreted of lichens and fungal hyphae of lichens split rocks into soil particles
	- dead lichens enrich organic content of soil
2. mosses, ferns, grasses communities
	- provide food & shelters for small insects and spiders
3. herbs community
	- provide food & shelters for more animals
4. shrubs community
	- larger animals move in
5. trees community (climax community)
	- form woodlands
	- maybe replaced by other plant community & continue to be climax community

**energy**:
- transfer of energy
	- light energy from sun
	- chemical energy in organic molecules from animals feeding on plants
	- chemical energy in organic molecules from animals feeding on other animals
- loss of energy
	- respiration
	- uneaten organism & body parts
	- egestion & excretion
