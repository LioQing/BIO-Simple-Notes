## Branches of Biology
- Molecular Biology - biology at molecular level
- Cytology - cells
- Anatomy - the body structure of organisms
- Botany - plants
- Zoology - animals
- Taxonomy - the classification of organisms
- Ecology - interactions between organisms and their environment
- Genetics - the passing of characteristics from parents to offspring

## Importance of Biology
- To understand the nature of life & appreciate the wonders of the living world
- To learn the relationships between organisms & the environment & respect for all organisms => increase awareness of social issue related to biology
- To apply the biological knowledge => improve standard of living
    - Food (cheese, yoghurt) produced with microorganisms
    - Antibiotics produced with microorganisms and vaccines are biotechnology
- To prepare for a future career - working in the medical fields and in environmental protection

## Scientific Method for Studying Biology
1. Making observations
2. Asking questions
3. Proposing hypothesis
4. Designing and doing experiment
5. Analysing results and drawing conclusion

## Characteristics of Organisms
- Nutrition
- Respiration
- Excretion
- Irritability/sensitivity
- Movement
- Growth
- Reproduction

## Nature of Science
- Science is based on evidences and observations of the natural world
- Science knowledge is tentative and subject to change
- Doing science require creativity and imagination
- Intepretation of observation is guided by out prior understanding of other theories and concepts
- Science is a process of ongoing inquiries
