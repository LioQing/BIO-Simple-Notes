## Human Genome Project (HGP)
Genome definition: the ***complete DNA sequence*** on a haploid set of chromosome  
Mapping definition: the ***identification and locating*** of genetic sequences

benefits & applications:  
- for studying and understanding of genes
- improve medical field
- new ways to tackle environmental problems
- forensics science
- agriculture & livestock breeding
- for studying and understanding evolution

limitations:  
- many gene functions are still unknown
- ethical, legal, social issues:  
	- ownership (who can use)
	- privacy (who can access)
	- psychological impact (non-treatable genetic disorders may cause anxiety)
	- public perception (discrimination)

## Recombinant DNA Technology  
is the process of isolating a DNA fragment from a donor cell and inserting it into the DNA of another cell  

Process:  
1. Isolating the ***DNA segment containing the gene of interest*** and amplify it by PCR
2. Add a ***restriction enzyme*** acting as a pair of molecular scissors to cut the gene of interest
3. Isolate a plasmid with the antibiotic resistance gene as selectable marker from a bacterial cell
4. Add the same ***restriction enzyme*** to ***cut open the circular plasmid***
5. The 'sticky ends' of the gene of interest and the open plasmid are ***complementary***, they join together by adding the enzyme ***DNA ligase*** to form a ***recombinant plasmid***
6. Plasmid acts as the ***vector*** to introduce the recominant DNA into a host cell, forming a recombinant bacterium, they are said to be transformed
7. The transformed bacteria are ***selected*** by spreadig the bacteria on sterile nutrient agar plate that contains antibiotic
8. The transformed bacteria are removed to culture in large scale in the sterile nutrient solution of a fermenter

### Application
- medical use
	- pharmaceutical products
		- vaccines (treated pathogens)
		- insulin (to cure diabetes mellitus)
	- gene therapy
- agriculture & food
	- genetically modified organisms (GMO)
		- BT bacterium
	- genetically modified food (GM food)
		- golden rice (more vitamin A)
		- tomato
		- GM salmon
- industrial application
	- GM microorganisms to produce enzymes
- environmental protection
	- wastes can be broken down by GM plants
	- clean up oil spill with GM bacteria

## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PRC)
used to produce numerous copies of a selected DNA segment by DNA polymerase  

process: 
1. ***DNA denaturation***
	- Heat the DNA to ***~95 degree Celcius***
	- the high temerpature denatures the double-stranded DNA by breaking the ***hydrogen bonds***
	- the DNA splits into 2 single-stranded DNA, each as a template
2. ***Annealing***
	- Cool the DNA to ***~55 degree Celcius***
	- Add ***2 different primers*** to the DNA strands
	- They bind respectively at the opposite ends of these 2 separated strands of DNA
	- The anealling of these 2 primers ***marks the selected DNA region to be amplified***
	- The temperature required is specific to the primer used
3. ***Extension***
	- Raise the temperature to ***72 degree Celcius (optimum temperature)***
	- ***DNA polymerase*** is used for attaching free nucleotides with complementary bases to the strands
	- ***Primer acts as the starting point*** for DNA synthesis
4. Amplification of DNA
	- DNA is ampified by repeating the 3 steps of PCR
	- Achieved by changing the temperature in the sequence of ***95 -> 55 -> 72 degree Celcius***
	- The new copies of DNA produced in previous cycle can act as template in the following cycles
	- The number of copies ***growth exponentially***
	- Can be done automatically in thermal cycler
	- within 30 to 40 cycles, millions copies of the DNA produced within few hours

### Application
- DNA fingerprinting (for forensic science)
- Detection of genetic disorder
	- detect genetic disorder due to chromosomal mutation
	- prenatal diagnosis, for amplifying foetal cells
- Archaeological study
- Human Genome Porject
- Diagnosis for infectious diseases

## DNA Fingerprinting

Principle: 
- Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR)
	- non-functional (non-coding) DNA
	- a short base sequence to repeat in linear manner, called tandem repeat
	- each sequence contains about 10 - 100 base pairs
	- repeating sequence normally is the same from person to person
	- number of times they repeat are different between individuals
	- length of repeat is inherited as an allele

### Restriction Fragment Length Prolymorphism (RFLP) Analysis
1. ***Extracting DNA*** from sample
2. Preparing restriction DNA fragments, with ***restriction enzyme***
3. Separating DNA fragments by ***gel electrophoresis***
	- with ***electric field***, shorter DNA move further away from well to the ***positive pole***
	- different size DNA fragments are separated into different bands due to ***length difference***
4. Blotting 
	- using nylon membrane
5. DNA Hybridization
	- radioactive or flourescent ***DNA probes*** for visualization
	- ***X-ray/photographic film*** for radioactive probes to get the fingerprint

Application:
- Forensic science
- Parentage test
- Victims identification
- Evolution and archaeological studies
- Detection of genetic disorders
- Test for GM food

## Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)

GMOs are organisms with their DNA inserted with foreign gene.  
Recombinant DNA technology is most commonly used for it.

Benefits:
- ***GM microorganisms*** act as micro-factories fro producing large amount of ***pharmaceutical products***
- Diagnositc tests
- Increase ***crop yields***, with pesticide
- Increase ***animal productivity and quality***
- GM crops ***reduce*** use of ***chemical pesticides***
- Forensic Science
- Scientific studies

Hazard:
- Potential ***undesirable long term effect***
- Antibiotic-resistant gene may make pathogens become ***super bugs***
- If GMOs are released into the environment, they can ***upset the ecological balance, or reduce biodiversity***
- Toxin produced by GM crops may ***kill other benefitial organisms***
