## GM Foods
- health issues
	- time on marcket is still short - unknown undesirable effects
	- allergic responses - food may contain allergic proteins will affect certain people
	- super bugs - if genes accidentally escape into the env. pathogens may become super bugs
	- toxins - insertion of foreign gene in wrong position may produce toxins
- env. issues
	- if herbicide-resistant gene escape into env. super weeds may appear and cannot be controlled
	- BT toxin gene set up selection pressure lead to evolution of resistant strain of pests
	- BT toxins by BT plants may kill non-target insects => reduce biodiversity
	- if GM crops escape into env. they have competitive properties => may become dominant species => upset biological balance, reduce biodiversity, affect evolution
- ethical issues
	- foreign genes from other animals
	- religious reasons
- legal issues
	- labeling of GM foods is required in HK

## Animal and Plant Cloning
- plant cloning
	- similar to GM foods
	- cloning lack of genetic variation => reduced biodiversity
- animal cloning
	- env. issues
		- cloning lack of genetic variation => reduce biodiversity
	- economic issues
		- very expensive
		- may have undesirable effects
	- ethical issues
		- success rate is low
		- wastage of animal life
	- ethical issues on human cloning
		- the right to play God
		- confusion in the relationship between the cloned person & others
		- identity problem
		- misusage to ones advantage

## Human Genome Project (HGP)
- ethical issues
	- genetic disorder of embryo => abortion
	- discovering own genetic disorder => anxiety
- legal issues
	- ownership of personal genetic information
	- discrimination of person with genetic information
	- discrimination of person's health insurance
- social issues
	- low-self esteem of genetically inferior people

## Gene Therapy
- social issues
	- only rich people can afford
	- engineering a person's future
	- germ line gene therapy lead to designer babies
	- unforeseeable hearmful effect
- legal issues
	- in germ line gene therapy, offspring has no informed consent
- economic and social issues
	- research fund is huge => cost effectiveness is questioned

## Stem Cell Therapy
- ethical issues
	- destruction of human embryos
	- save a person's life by killing other
- social issue
	- permitting destruction of embryos lowers the value of life in society
