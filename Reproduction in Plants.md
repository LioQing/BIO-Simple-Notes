## Asexual Reproduction
method: mitotic cell division
genetic make-up of offspring: genetically identical to parents
remark: offsprings are called clones

types:
- binary fission
- vegetative propagation

## Types of Vegetative Propagation
- rhizomes
	- properties
		- grow horizontally
	- examples
		- ginger
		- lotus
		- iris
		- water lily
		- grasses
- stem tubers
	- properties
		- swollen ends of lateral stems
	- examples
		- potato
		- artichokes
		- arrow head
- bulbs
	- properties
		- condensed stems 
		- overlapping fleshy scale leaves
	- examples
		- onion
		- garlic
		- daffodil
		- tulip
- corms
	- properties
		- short
		- vertical
	- examples
		- crocus
		- gladiolus
		- water chestnut

advantage:
- parent store large amount of food for daughter -> rapid way of reproduction
- not rely on external agents
- genetically identical daughter to parent, desireable traits are inherited directly

disadvantage:  
- daughter produced around parent -> overcrowding & competition
- parent may pass undesirable traits or disease to daughter
- no genetic variation -> less adaptable to environmental change  

significance:  
- large number of offspring withint a short period of time
- genetically identical daughter to parents, inherit desirable traits
- no need to find a mate, save time, energy and resources

## Sexual Reproduction
method: fusion of gametes produced by meiotic cell division
genetic make-up of offspring: different from parents
remarks: fertilization produces a haploid zygotes
remarks: genetic variation is produced by meiotic cell division & random fertilization

significant:  
- production of genetic variation to better adapt to environmental changes
- survive through adverse conditions

## Pollination
def: the transfer of pollen grain from anther to the stigma

types:
- self-pollination
- cross-pollination

<empty/> | self-pollination | cross-pollination
--- | --- | ---
genetic variation | less, less adaptable to env. change | greater, adapt better to env. change 
species strength | weakened, less seeds and vigorous | strong, more seeds
dependent on external agent | no, high fertilization chance | yes, insecure
wastage of pollen grains | less | high

vectors of pollination:  
- insect / animal
- wind
- water

## Fertilization

steps:
1. stigma stimulates the pollen grain to germinate a pollen tube
2. the pollen tube secretes enzymes to digest tissues of the style and grow towards the ovule
3. pollen tube carries the male gametes towards the ovule
4. male gametes are released through the micropyle of ovule to fuse with the ovum
6. a zygote is formed

## Counterparts of Flower in Fruit

style and receptacle -> scars  
ovary -> fruit  
ovary wall -> fruit wall  
ovule -> seed  
integument -> seed coat
ovum -> embryo
