## Asexual Reproduction
method: mitotic cell division
genetic make-up of offspring: genetically identical to parents
remark: offsprings are called clones

types:
- binary fission
- vegetative propagation

## Types of Vegetative Propagation
- rhizomes
	- properties
		- grow horizontally
	- examples
		- ginger
		- lotus
		- iris
		- water lily
		- grasses
- stem tubers
	- properties
		- swollen ends of lateral stems
	- examples
		- potato
		- artichokes
		- arrow head
- bulbs
	- properties
		- condensed stems 
		- overlapping fleshy scale leaves
	- examples
		- onion
		- garlic
		- daffodil
		- tulip
- corms
	- properties
		- short
		- vertical
	- examples
		- crocus
		- gladiolus
		- water chestnut

advantage:
- parent store large amount of food for daughter -> rapid way of reproduction
- not rely on external agents
- genetically identical daughter to parent, desireable traits are inherited directly

disadvantage:  
- daughter produced around parent -> overcrowding & competition
- parent may pass undesirable traits or disease to daughter
- no genetic variation -> less adaptable to environmental change  

significance:  
- large number of offspring withint a short period of time
- genetically identical daughter to parents, inherit desirable traits
- no need to find a mate, save time, energy and resources

## Sexual Reproduction
method: fusion of gametes produced by meiotic cell division
genetic make-up of offspring: different from parents
remarks: fertilization produces a haploid zygotes
remarks: genetic variation is produced by meiotic cell division & random fertilization

significant:  
- production of genetic variation to better adapt to environmental changes
- survive through adverse conditions

## Pollination
def: the transfer of pollen grain from anther to the stigma

types:
- self-pollination
- cross-pollination
