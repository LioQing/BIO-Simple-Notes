## Stimulus  
plural:  stimuli  
def: an environmental change  

## Receptors and Senses  
stimuli | receptors | sense organs | sensation  
--- | --- | --- | ---  
light energy | photoreceptor cell (light-sensitive cell) | eye | vision  
sound wave | mechanoreceptor | ear | hearing  
chemcials in food | chemoreceptor | tongue | taste  
chemicals in air | chemoreceptor | nose | smell  
touch, pressure | mechanoreceptor | skin | touch  
temperature change | thermoreceptor | skin | cold/hot  

## Effectors (Motor Organs)  
def: organs that receive nerve impulses from brain to produce responses

**structures**:  
- Scelera  
	- outermost, tough, white, opaque layer made of fibres
	- protects the inner sturctures  
	- maintains the shape of the eyeball  
	- attaches with the eye muscles  
- Choroid  
	- contains black pigment to absorb light to reduce reflection
	- contains blood vessels with supply nutrients and oxygen  
- Retina  
	- innermost layer made of nerve fibres  
	- contains photoreceptor: cone cells and rod cells  
- Conjunctiva
	- thin transparent layer
	- allows light to enter the eye
- Cornea
	- a transparent area of scelera
	- allows light to enter the eye
	- curved surface refracts light
- Iris
	- pigmented muscular structure  
	- composed of radial and circular muscles which control the light entering the eye by changing size of pupil
- Pupil
	- a hole at the center of iris
	- allows light to enter the eye
- Lens
	- transparent, elastic, biconvex
	- refracts and focuses light onto the retina
- Suspensory ligament
	- connects lens to the ciliary body
- Ciliary body/muscle
	- controls the refraction of light onto the retina by regulating the tension of the suspensory ligament and control the thickness of the lens  
- Aqueous humour
	- watery fluid filling the anterior chamber
	- allows nutrients and oxygen diffuse from choroid to conjunctiva, cornea and lens
	- maintains the shape of the eyeball
	- refracts light onto the retina
- Vitreous humour
	- jelly-like fuild filling the posterior chamber
	- maintains the shape of the eyeball
	- refracts light onto the retina
- Optic nerve
	- transmits nerve impulses from retina to the brain
- Yellow spot (fovea)
	- highest density of cone cells
	- no rod cells
- Blind spot
	- no photoreceptor
	- no vision  

**control the amount of light entering the eye**  
key: (*[ in dim light ]*/*[ in bright light ]*)
1. circular muscles (contract/relax) & radial muscles (relax/contract)
2. pupil (dilates/constricts)
3. (more/less) light enters the eye

**photoreceptors**  
</empty> | rod cells | cone cells
--- | --- | ---
contains | pigment visual purple | types for red, green, blue light
sensitivity to light intensity | dim light | bright light
vision | black and white | colour
distribution | none at yellow spot and blind spot | concentrated at yellow spot, none at blind spot

**eye accomodation**  
key: ([ near ]/[ distant ])
1. ciliary muscles (contract/relax)
2. suspensory ligament's tension (decreases/increases)
3. lens becomes (more/less) convex
4. lights are (more/less) converged

**eye defects**
- short-sight
	- cause: 
		- eyeball too long
		- lens too convex
	- effect: 
		- distant objects are blurred
		- can only see near objects clearly
- long-sight
	- cause: 
		- eyeball too short
		- lens too less convex
	- effect: 
		- near objects are blurred
		- can only see distant objects clearly
- colour blindness
	- cause:
		- lack of certain colour cone cell or dificiency
		- inherited
	- effect:
		- cannot distinguish colours
- astigmatism
	- cause:
		- uneven curvature of cornear or lens
	- effect:
		- vision is blurred
