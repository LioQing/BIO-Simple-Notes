## Genetic Material

### Chromosomes
- a single thread-like structure
- consist of a DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid)
- functionally consist of a fixed number of genes which contains genetic info

Appearance:  
When not dividing, they are _chromatin_:
- very fine thread-like structure
- cannot be seen under a light microscope

When dividing, they are _2 identical sister chromatids_ joined with a _centromere_:  
- shorten and thicken as rod-like structure
- can be seen under a light microscope

### Homologous chromosomes
Human has *__46__* chromosomes, *__23 pairs__* of homologous chromosomes  

Chromosomes exists in pairs called *__homologous chromosomes__*:
- the members:
    - are in similar size and shape
    - contain the same kinds of genes
    - X and Y are sex chromosomes, but are __*not homologous*__
    - one of each pair comes from male parent is called paternal chromosome
    - another member comes from female parent is called maternal chromosome
- number of chromosome sets
    - body cell having 2 sets of chromosomes is diploid (2N)
    - sex cell having 1 sets of chromosome is haploid (N)

## Cell Cycle
Main stages:
1. Interphase
2. Cell division
    1. nuclear division
    2. cytoplasmic

Types of nuclear division:
- Mitotic cell division
- Meiotic cell division

### Lenght of cell cycle
- Most cells never divide again after they are differentiated - they remain at G1 phase
    - guard cell
    - most nerve cells
    - red blood cells
- Some undifferentiated cells divide continuously
    - skin cells
    - epithelial cells of the small intestine
    - cells in the root tips and shoot tips

## Interphase
is the perioud between 2 successive cell divisions

- nuclear is 'resting'
- chromosomes are in the form of chromatin
- active cell growth to prepare for the cell division
    - active synthesis of proteins and organelles
    - replication of DNA

## Mitosis (Mitotic Cell Division)
produces 2 daughter nuclei containing chromosome sets identical to the parent cell

Stages:
1. Prophase  
    - chromatin thicken and shorten, so chromosomes become visible
    - nuclear membrane break down
2. Metaphase  
    - chromosomes line up individually in the middle of the cell
    - the paried sister chromatids attached to the spindle fibre by the centromere
3. Anaphase
    - centromere split
    - the spindle fibre pulls the two sister chromatids to the opposite poles of the cell
    - the separated chromatids are called daughter chromosomes
4. Telophase
    - nuclear membrane is formed around each of the daughter chromosomes
    - producing 2 daughter nuclei

Importance:
- Growth
- Repair or replacement
    - flowering plant: root cap of root tip
    - mammal: alimentary canal
- Asexual reproduction
    - binary fission
    - vegetative propagation
    - cloning

## Meiosis (Meitic Cell Division)
take place in gamete-producing cells  
produces 4 haploid nuclei  
aka reduction division

General stages:
1. First meiotic division
2. Second meiotic division
3. Cytoplasmic division

Stages:
1. Prophase I
	- chromatin thicken and shorten, so chromosomes become visible
	- members of each pair of homologous chromosomes pair up
	- nuclear membrane break down
	- exchange of genetic segments by crossing-over
2. Metaphase I
	- pairs of homologous chromosomes line up randomly in the middle of the cell
	- the centromere attaches to the spindle fibre, sister chromatids do not split
3. Anaphase I
	- each members of each pair of the homologous chromosomes separate the pulled by spindle fibre towards the opposite poles of the cell
	- cytoplasm begin to divide
4. Telophase I
	- when the chromosomes reached their respective ends, nuclear membrane forms to form 2 haploid daughter nuclei
5. Prophase II
	- nuclear membrane start to break down
6. Metaphase II
	- chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell
	- centromere of each chromosomes attaches to new spindle fibres
7. Anaphase II
	- centromere split
	- spindle fibres pull the sister chromatids apart and move them to the opposite poles
8. Telophase II
	- become chromatin
	- nuclear membrane reforms around each daughter nucleic

Examples:
- Flowering plants
	- anther produce haploid pollen grains
	- ovule produces haploid egg cells
- Mammals
	- testis produces haploid sperms
	- ovary produces haploid egg cells

**_Promotion of Genetic Variations during Meiotic Cell Division_**
- Crossing-over -- exchange of genetic segments between __*non-sister chromatids*__ at prophase I
- Independent assortment -- random arrangement of different pairs of homologous chromosomes
- Fusion of different gametes in fertilization is random

## Comparison between Mitotic Cell Division and Meiotic Cell Division
**_Similarities_**:
- involve replication of DNA and the subsequent separation of chromosomes
- involve the formation of spindle fibre to move the chromosomes apart to opposite poles

__*Differences*__:
</empty> | Mitotic cell division | Meiotic cell division
--- | --- | ---
Sites of occurance | Body cells | Gamete-producing cells in sex organs
Pairing of homologous chromosomes | No | Yes
Crossing-over | No | Yes
Independent assortment | No | Yes
Genetic make-up of daughter cells | Identical to parents and among daughter cells | Different from parents and among daughter cells
Number of daughter cells produced | 2 | 4
Type of cells produced | Body (somatic) cells | Gametes
Number of chromosomes in daughter cells | Same as parents (diploid)(2N) | Half of parents (haploid)(N)
Importance | Growth, repair, asexual reproduction | sexual reproduction that preserve the number of chromosomes, produces genetic variation to enhance survival of the species


## Cytoplasmic Division
called cytokinesis

In animal cells:  
1. cell membrane constricts inwards around the middle of the cell
2. cut the cell into 2 daughter cells

In plant cell:
1. a cell plate is formed between the 2 daughter nuclei
2. the cell plate grows outwardds until it completely separate the cytoplasm
