## Genetic Material

### Chromosomes
- a single thread-like structure
- consist of a DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid)
- functionally consist of a fixed number of genes which contains genetic info

Appearance:  
When not dividing, they are _chromatin_:
- very fine thread-like structure
- cannot be seen under a light microscope

When dividing, they are _2 identical sister chromatids_ joined with a _centromere_:  
- shorten and thicken as rod-like structure
- can be seen under a light microscope

### Homologous chromosomes
Human has 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes  

Chromosomes exists in pairs called _homologous chromosomes_:
- the members:
    - are in similar size and shape
    - contain the same kinds of genes
    - X and Y are sex chromosomes, but are not homologous
    - one of each pair comes from male parent is called paternal chromosome
    - another member comes from female parent is called maternal chromosome
- number of chromosome sets
    - body cell having 2 sets of chromosomes is diploid (2N)
    - sex cell having 1 sets of chromosome is haploid (N)

## Cell Cycle
Main stages:
1. Interphase
2. Cell division
    1. nuclear division
    2. cytoplasmic

Types of nuclear division:
- Mitotic cell division
- Meiotic cell division

### Lenght of cell cycle
- Most cells never divide again after they are differentiated - they remain at G1 phase
    - guard cell
    - most nerve cells
    - red blood cells
- Some undifferentiated cells divide continuously
    - skin cells
    - epithelial cells of the small intestine
    - cells in the root tips and shoot tips

## Interphase
is the perioud between 2 successive cell divisions

- nuclear is 'resting'
- chromosomes are in the form of chromatin
- active cell growth to prepare for the cell division
    - active synthesis of proteins and organelles
    - replication of DNA

## Mitosis (Mitotic Cell Division)
produces 2 daughter nuclei containing chromosome sets identical to the parent cell

Stages:
1. Prophase  
    - chromatin thicken and shorten, so chromosomes become visible
    - nuclear membrane break down
2. Metaphase  
    - chromosomes line up0 individually in the middle of the cell
    - the paried sister chromatids attached to the spindle fibre by the centromere
3. Anaphase
    - centromere split
    - the spindle fibre pulls the two sister chromatids to the opposite poles of the cell
    - the separated chromatids are called daughter chromosomes
4. Telophase
    - nuclear membrane is formed around each of the daughter chromosomes
    - producing 2 daughter nuclei

Importance:
- Growth
- Repair or replacement
    - flowering plant: root cap of root tip
    - mammal: alimentary canal
- Asexual reproduction
    - binary fission
    - vegetative propagation
    - cloning

## Meiosis (Meitic Cell Division)
take place in gamete-producing cells  
produces 4 haploid nuclei  
aka reduction division

Consist of 2 successive division:  
First and second meiotic division

Stages:
1. Prophase I
2. Metaphase I
3. Anaphase I
4. Telophase I
5. Prophase II
6. Metaphase II
7. Anaphase II
8. Telophase II

## Cytoplasmic Division
called cytokinesis

In animal cells:  
1. cell membrane constricts inwards around the middle of the cell
2. cut the cell into 2 daughter cells

In plant cell:
1. a cell plate is formed between the 2 daughter nuclei
2. the cell plate grows outwardds until it completely separate the cytoplasm
