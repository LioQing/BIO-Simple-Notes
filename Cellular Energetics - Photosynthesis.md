## Chloroplast
- Double membrane
	- Inner membrane
		- extends inward to form thylakoid
	- Outer membrane
		- regulate the passage of materials in and out
- Thylakoid
	- Granum
		- stack of thylakoid
		- increase surface are to pack more chlorophyll
	- Intergranal thylakoid
		- grana connected to each other by intergranal thylakoid
		- increase efficient transport of photosynthetic products
- Stroma
	- site of carbon fixation
	- contains starch grain for storage of photosynthetic products
