## Fossil Records

formation - **fossilization**:  
1. when an organism die, its **soft part decayed** and **hard parts are buried in mud and sand**
2. the mud and sand **become rock due to great pressure** from upper layers of sediment
3. **mineral deposit** in the hard parts and **become fossil** (hardened)
4. **Earth movement and erosion or weathering** expose the fossils

uses as an evidence for evolution:  
- estimation of when the organisms existed
	- **radioisotope dating**
	- **lower** layers are **earlier** fossils and **higher** layers are **later** fossils
- prove **life forms arose from pre-existing life forms**
- show organisms become **more complex in structure and more diversified**

limitation:  
- there are **missing links**
- **soft-bodied** organisms usually **cannot** be fossilized
- the bodies of dead organisms might be **eaten by other organisms** or **decayed** before fossilization
- the organisms died in **conditions not suitable for fossilization**
- most fossils are **incomplete** or **damaged** (e.g. by earth movment)
- some fossils are located in **inaccessible areas**


## Natural Selection

process:
1. **Genetic variations** among a population
2. Certain process lets *individuals with favourable trait* **survive** and **reproduce** with higher chance, killing others
3. the **proportion** of *individuals with favourable trait* **increase** in **later generations**  

## Speciation

process:
1. A population is **separated by** *certain isolation method*  
2. The 2 separated groups **no longer interbreed**
3. **Natural selection** acts on the 2 groups **in different ways**
4. They **evolve independently** by retaining **different favourable variations**
5. **Accumulation of variations** causes them to separate into 2 species
