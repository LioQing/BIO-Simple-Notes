## Fossil Records

types:
- body fossils - provide the information on the existence nad how they look like
	- skull
	- tooth
	- shell
- trace fossils - provide the information on the acitivities of the organisms
	- dung
	- footprint
	- burrows

formation - **fossilization**:  
1. when an organism die, its **soft part decayed** and **hard parts are buried in mud and sand**
2. the mud and sand **become rock due to great pressure** from upper layers of sediment
3. **mineral deposit** in the hard parts and **become fossil** (hardened)
4. **Earth movement and erosion or weathering** expose the fossils

uses as an evidence for evolution:  
- estimation of when the organisms existed
	- **radioisotope dating**
	- **lower** layers are **earlier** fossils and **higher** layers are **later** fossils
- prove **life forms arose from pre-existing life forms**
- show organisms become **more complex in structure and more diversified**

limitation:  
- there are **missing links**
- **soft-bodied** organisms usually **cannot** be fossilized
- the bodies of dead organisms might be **eaten by other organisms** or **decayed** before fossilization
- the organisms died in **conditions not suitable for fossilization**
- most fossils are **incomplete** or **damaged** (e.g. by earth movment)
- some fossils are located in **inaccessible areas**

## Other Evidence for Evolution

- homologous structures
	- different function, same basic design
	- e.g. pantadactyl limbs in forelimbs of mammals

## Comparative Biochemistry

by comparing to find the **phylogenetic (evolutionary) relationship** between different species

- **base sequence of DNA**
- **amino acid sequence in proteins**
	- haemoglobin in humans with other vertebrates

**smaller** difference in the sequence  
=> **fewer mutations** have occurred  
=> **closer** the phylogenetic relationship

## Mechanisms of Evolution

**Lamarkism**  

environmental changes created needs  
=> certain structures were repeatedly used and become well developed
=> certain structures were not used and degenerate
=> acquired characters are passed on to later generations

proven wrong:
1. tails of mice were cut off over many generations
2. mice of each generations were born with complete tails
3. probe acquired characters were not passed on to later generations  

**Darwinism**

Observation | Deduction
--- | ---
organisms are able to **produce large numbers of offspring**, but the **population remains fairly stable** | many fails to survive and reproduce due to **competition** for limited resources, struggle for existence
**variations** among individuals of the same species | favourable characters are better adapted for the environment => **higher chance of survival**, survival of the fittest
some **favourable characters are passed on to offspring** | better adapted individuals **survive and reproduce and pass their favourable characters to their offspring** => **accumulation of characters over many generations** makes the species difference from their ancestor

**Neo-darwinism**

incorporation of modern knowledge of genetics in mutation, inheritance, and related area of biology refine the theory of natural selection

## Natural Selection

process:
1. **Genetic variations** among a population
2. Certain process lets *individuals with favourable trait* **survive** and **reproduce** with higher chance, killing others
3. the **proportion** of *individuals with favourable trait* **increase** in **later generations**  

## Speciation

isolation mechanisms: 
- **geographical isolation** - **physical barrier** separates them
- ecological isolation - occupy slightly difference place in the same habitat
- seasonal isolation - breed at different time
- behavioural isolation - different courtship behaviour
- mechanical isolation - sex organs are incompatible
- postmating isolation - gametes are incompatible and connot fuse, hybrid offspring is infertile or inviable

process:
1. A population is **separated by** *certain isolation mechanism*  
2. The 2 separated groups **no longer interbreed**
3. **Natural selection** acts on the 2 groups **in different ways**
4. They **evolve independently** by retaining **different favourable variations**
5. **Accumulation of variations** causes them to not able to interbreed and separate into 2 species
