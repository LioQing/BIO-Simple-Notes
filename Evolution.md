## Natural Selection

process:
1. **Genetic variations** among a population
2. Certain process lets *individuals with favourable trait* **survive** and **reproduce** with higher chance, killing others
3. the **proportion** of *individuals with favourable trait* **increase** in **later generations**  

## Speciation

process:
1. A population is **separated by** *certain isolation method*  
2. The 2 separated groups **no longer interbreed**
3. **Natural selection** acts on the 2 groups **in different ways**
4. They **evolve independently** by retaining **different favourable variations**
5. **Accumulation of variations** causes them to separate into 2 species
