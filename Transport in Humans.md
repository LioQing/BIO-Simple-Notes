## Importance of Transport System
mammals have small S.A. to volume ratio, substances diffuse through our surface to centre of body is too slow and inefficient  
transport system transport substances to all the parts of our body

2 systems:  
- circulatory system
- lymphatic system

## Blood
- plasma
	- blood proteins
		- fibrinogen (soluble) - for blood clotting
		- antibodies (insoluble) - for defense against infection
	- soluble food substances
		- glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins
	- mineral salts
		- ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, etc.
	- metabolic wastes
		- urea, CO2
	- hormones
		- insulin
	- gases
		- CO2, oxygen, nitrogen
- red blood cell (erythrocyte) (abbr. RBC)
	- haemoglobin
		- increases oxygen carrying capacity
	- biconcave disc shape
		- increase S.A. to absorb & release more oxygen
	- no nucleus
		- provides more space to hold more haemoglobin
- white blood cell (leucocyte) (abbr. WBC)
	- phagocytes
		- lobular nucleus
		- engulf & digest pathogens, dead body cells
		- amoeboid movement to squeeze through capillary walls
	- lymphocytes
		- large round nucleus
		- produce antibodies to clump pathogens together for phagocytes to engulf
		- produce antibodies to neutralize toxins secreted by bacteria
- blood platelets
	- enhance blood clotting
		- prevent blood loss
		- prevent entry of pathogens

**functions**  
- transport
	- gases
		- oxygen carried in form of oxyhaemoglobin in RBC from lungs to tissues
		- CO2 carried in form of hydrogencarbonate ions in plasma from tissue cells to lungs
	- nutrients
		- glucose, amino acids, vitamins, minerals from small intestine to variouos organs
	- metabolic wastes
		- ammonia & urea from liver to kidney
	- hormones
		- secreted by endocrine glands to target organs
	- heat
		- produced in respiration (from muscles & livers) transport by blood to other body parts
			- to prevent muscles and liver too hot
			- keep rest of body warm
- defense agaisnt infection
	- phagocytes
		- engulf & digest the pathogens
	- lymphocytes
		- produce antibodies to kill the pathogens
		- antibodies to clump pathogens together for phagocyte to engulf
		- neutralize toxins from pathogens
	- blood platelets
		- start & help blood clotting to prevent entry of pathogens & loss of blood
- regulate body temperature
	- helps maintaining body temperature by distributing heat throughout the body

## Main Blood Vessels
heart -> aorta -> arteries -> arterioles -> capillaries -> venules -> veins -> vena cava -> heart

comparison between arteries & veins
</empty> | arteries | veins
--- | --- | ---
direction of blood flow | **away** from heart to other parts of body | from body cells/tissues **to** heart
blood content | **oxygenated** blood (except pulmonary artery & umbililcal artery) | **deoxygenated** blood (except pulmonary vein & umbilical vein)
**structure** of wall | **thick** & **elastic** to withstand the high blooc pressure | **thin**, less muscular and elastic
**structure** of wall | more **muscular** with contraction & relaxation arteries can be constricted or dilated to regulate blood supply |
**structure** of valves | absent (except pulmonary artery & aorta) | present to prevent the backflow of blood
rate of blood flow | rapid, flow with pulse | slow, flow steadily with no pulse
blood pressure | high due to heart pumping to arteries | low pressure
position | deep in body to have protection against injury | near skin surface
lumen | smaller | larger
ways to maintain blood flow | cardiac muscles pumping from heart | skeletal muscles around the vein aids one-way flow & valves preventing backflow

## Heart
- located between the lungs in thoracic cavity
- enclosed by pericardium

image from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Heart_diagram-en.svg

- auricles (atria)
	- relatively thin wall
	- receive blood with low pressure from veins
	- right atrium receive deoxygenated blood from
		- superior (anterior) vena cava
		- inferior (posterior) vena cava
	- left atrium receive oxygenated blood from pulmonary veins
- ventricles
	- thicker wall than atrium
	- right ventricle pump deoxygenated blood to lungs via pulmonary artery
	- left ventricle pump oxygenated blood to the whole body except lungs via aorta
	- left ventricular wall is thicker than right ventricular wall, because it pumps to whole body (except lungs) while right ventricle only pumps to lungs
- heart valves
	- to prevent backflow of blood
	- ensure blood flow through heart is unidirectional
	- tricuspid valve
		- from right atrium to right ventricle
		- has 3 flaps
	- bicuspid valve (mitral valve)
		- from left atrium to left ventricle
		- has 2 flaps
		- the closure produce first heart sound 'lub'
	- chordae tendineae
		- prevent valve from being turned inside out
		- present on bicuspid valve & tricuspid valve
	- semilunar valve
		- present at the base of pulmonary artery & aorta
		- half-moon shaped
		- the closure produce second heart sound 'dub'

## Cardiac Cycle
1. atrial systole (0.0s - 0.1s)
	- atria contract to pump blood to ventricles
	- tricuspid & bicuspid opens
	- semilunar valve close
2. ventricular systole (0.1s - 0.4s)
	- ventricles contract
		- right ventricle to the lungs via pulmonary artery
		- left ventricle to other parts of body except lungs via aorta
	- semilunar valves open
	- tricuspid & bicuspid corced to shut to prevent backflow to pulmonary vein & vena cavae
3. diastole (0.4s - 0.8s)
	- atria & ventricles relax
	- blood flows into atria, and atria to ventricles
	- tricuspid & bicuspid valves forced to open
	- low blood pressure in ventricles causes semilunar valves to close, preventing backflow of blood into ventricles

## Double Circulatory in Humans
- pulmonary circulation
	- circulation between lungs & heart
- systemic circulation
	- circulation between heart and all body tissues except lungs

advantages:  
- septum separates heart into 4 chambers
	- prevent oxygenated blood mixing with deoxygenated blood
	- esures only oxygenated blood is pumped to the organs
	- support high metabolic rate
- blood is pumped twice
	- blood pressure is maintained to ensure rapid blood flow

## Blood Clotting
1. blood platelets exposed to air & in contact with damaged tissue
2. release enzyme to start a chain of reactions
3. the soluble plasma protein, fibrinogen changes into insoluble threads, fibrin
4. the network of fibrin traps blood cells to form a clot
5. after fibrinogen is removed, serum is remained
	
## Exchange of Materials at the Capillaries Network
**tissue fluid**  
function:  
- serve as medium for the exchange of materials between blood & body cells
- provide a relatively stable env. for the functioning of body cells

formation:  
1. at arteriole end of capillary, high blood pressure forces plasma to pass through the wall
2. RBC, blood platelets, and plasma proteins are too big to pass through the wall
3. most water passes back to veneous end of capillaries by osmosis
3. WBC can squeeze through capillary wall by amoeboid movement

composition:  
- similar as plasma except no blood & plasma protein

**capillaries**  
function:
- smallest blood vessels
- reach every part of body

adaptation:
- greatly branched => increase S.A. for exchange of materials
- capillary wall is thin (one-cell thick) provide short distance to faciliate material exchange
- large total cross-sectional area => blood flow slow => sufficient and longer time for exchange

## Lymphatic System

function:  
- assist the circulatory system to transport substances
- return excess tissue fluid to blood stream
- transport absorbed lipids from lacteals of the intestine to heart
- lymph nodes filter out pathogens and kills them
- produce WBC
- keeps the cells in condition for diffusion between capillaries & tissue cells

**lymph**  
formation:  
- tissue fluid drained into lymph capillaries are lymph

composition:  
- no RBC, blood platelet
- resembles plasma except no protein
- lymph nodes produce WBC, hence lymph has WBC

**lymph nodes**  
structure:  
- swellings present along the lymph vessels
- prodce large number of WBC
- filters lymph before going to the subclavian veins
- bacteria & toxins in the lymph are destroyed by WBC in lymph nodes

**lymph vessels**  
structure:  
- no pump
- vavles to prevent backflow of lymph
- path: lymph capillaries -> lymph vessels -> subclavian veins -> superior vena cava -> heart
- lies between tissue cells
