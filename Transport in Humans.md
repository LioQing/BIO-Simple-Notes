## Importance of Transport System
mammals have small S.A. to volume ratio, substances diffuse through our surface to centre of body is too slow and inefficient  
transport system transport substances to all the parts of our body

2 systems:  
- circulatory system
- lymphatic system

## Blood
- plasma
	- blood proteins
		- fibrinogen (soluble) - for blood clotting
		- antibodies (insoluble) - for defense against infection
	- soluble food substances
		- glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins
	- mineral salts
		- ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, etc.
	- metabolic wastes
		- urea, CO2
	- hormones
		- insulin
	- gases
		- CO2, oxygen, nitrogen
- red blood cell (erythrocyte) (abbr. RBC)
	- haemoglobin
		- increases oxygen carrying capacity
	- biconcave disc shape
		- increase S.A. to absorb & release more oxygen
	- no nucleus
		- provides more space to hold more haemoglobin
- white blood cell (leucocyte) (abbr. WBC)
	- phagocytes
		- lobular nucleus
		- engulf & digest pathogens, dead body cells
		- amoeboid movement to squeeze through capillary walls
	- lymphocytes
		- large round nucleus
		- produce antibodies to clump pathogens together for phagocytes to engulf
		- produce antibodies to neutralize toxins secreted by bacteria
- blood platelets
	- enhance blood clotting
		- prevent blood loss
		- prevent entry of pathogens

blood cells
</empty> | RBC | WBC | blood platelets
--- | --- | --- | ---
shape | biconcave disc shape | irregular shape | ireegular shape or oval shape, tiny
nucleus | none | big nucleus round or lobed | none
colour | red | colourless | colourless
size | small (diameter: 8 μm, thickness: 2μm) | larger than RBC (phagocytes: 10 - 20 μm diameter, lymphocytes: 6 - 10 μm diameter) | smaller than RBC (2 - 3 μm diameter)
number | 5.4 million per mm<sup>3</sup> | 7000 per mm<sup>3</sup> | 150 - 450 x 10<sup>3</sup> per mm<sup>3</sup>
function | contain haemoglobin to carry oxgen | for body defense (phagocytes: engulf bacteria, lymphocytes: produce antibodies to act against bacteria) | enhance blood clotting to prevent further entry of pathogens & blood loss
site of production | bone marrow | bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes | broken pieces of bone marrow cells
life span | 120 days | 4 days | 8 - 9 days
site of destruction | liver & spleen (haemoglobin to iron * bile pigment) | killed by bacteria & passed out in faeces | liver & spleen  

**functions**  
- transport
	- gases
		- oxygen carried in form of oxyhaemoglobin in RBC from lungs to tissues
		- CO2 carried in form of hydrogencarbonate ions in plasma from tissue cells to lungs
	- nutrients
		- glucose, amino acids, vitamins, minerals from small intestine to variouos organs
	- metabolic wastes
		- ammonia & urea from liver to kidney
	- hormones
		- secreted by endocrine glands to target organs
	- heat
		- produced in respiration (from muscles & livers) transport by blood to other body parts
			- to prevent muscles and liver too hot
			- keep rest of body warm
- defense agaisnt infection
	- phagocytes
		- engulf & digest the pathogens
	- lymphocytes
		- produce antibodies to kill the pathogens
		- antibodies to clump pathogens together for phagocyte to engulf
		- neutralize toxins from pathogens
	- blood platelets
		- start & help blood clotting to prevent entry of pathogens & loss of blood
- regulate body temperature
	- helps maintaining body temperature by distributing heat throughout the body
