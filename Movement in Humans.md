- compact bone
    - made up of calcium phosphate
    - functions
        - provide support
        - store calcium phosphate
- spongy bone
    - inside the ends of a bone
    - functions
        - porous to absorb shock and resist stress
- red bone marrow
    - inside the cavities of spongy bone
    - functions
        - produces red blood cells and white blood cells
- yellow bone marrow
    - inside the inner part of the bone
- blood vessels
    - supply oxygen and nutrients and remove carbon dioxide and wastes
- nerves
    - give sensation of the bone for balance

## Cartilage
- composition
    - living cells
    - mineral salts
- functions
    - act as a cushion to reduce friction
    - avoid wearing of bones
    - gives shape and support to some organs

## Joints

structures: 
- ligaments
    - enclosing the joints like a capsules to prevent dislocation
    - elastic to permit the bones to move about
    - tough to prevent from being teared
- synovial membrane
    - secretes synovial fluid into the synovial cavity
    - synovial fluid acts as a lubricant to reduce friction so bones can move smoothly
    - synovial fluid nourishes the cartilage cells
- cartilage
    - elastic and smooth to absorb shock and reduce friction
    - protects bones from wearing away

types:
- hinge joints
    - elbow joint
    - knee joint
- ball and socket joints
    - shoulder joint
    - hip joint

## Roles of Didfferent Structures
- skeleton
    - forms strong framework to support the body
    - provide surface for muscle attachment
    - act as levers to transmit force generated by the muscles
- muscles
    - provide power
- joints
    - immovable joints to fuse bones together
    - movable joints to let bones to move about
- ligaments
    - elastic fibres to bind bones across joints to prevent dislocation
    - elastic fibres allows bones to move
    - tough to prevent from being teared
- tendons
    - inelastic fibres to transmit the force from muscles to bone
    - tough to preven from being teared
