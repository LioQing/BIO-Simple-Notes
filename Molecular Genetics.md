## Terms

- DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid
- RNA - ribonucleic acid
- tRNA - transfer RNA
- mRNA - messenger RNA
- rRNA - ribosomal RNA, used to make ribosome
- ribosome - involved in translation
- RNA polymerase - enzyme for catalysing free ribonucleotides to bind on tempalate strand
- template / non-coding / antisense strand - complementary to sequence of mRNA
- coding / sense strand - same as mRNA except T for U

## Genetic Materials
**chromosomes**  
conaints DNA & proteins  

**DNA**  
- made of 2 parrallel polunucleotides  
	- phosphate group  
	- 5-C sugar
	- nitrogenous base
- double helix
	- held by hydrogen bond
	- base sequences complementary to each other

**genetic codes**  
features:  
- triplet code (3 consecutive bases)  
- degenerate code (same amino acid may be coded by several codons)  
- code without comma
- non-overlapping code
- universal code (for all known organisms)

## Bases

complementary pairs table  
letter | name | letter | name
--- | --- | --- | ---
A | adenine | T(DNA) / U(RNA) | thymine(DNA) / urecil(RNA)
C | cytosine | G | guanine

## Protein Synthesis

Main stages:
1. **Transcription** - in **nucleus**
2. **Translation** - in **cytoplasm**

**Transcription**  

Steps:
1. **hydrogen bond of DNA broken** by an enzyme
2. DNA **unwind**, separate into **template and coding strands**
3. **RNA polymerase** attaches to **start codon** of the **template strand**
4. nucleotides attaches to the RNA polymerase as it **moves from start to stop codon**
5. RNA polymerase **catalyses free ribonucleotides** in nucleus
6. nucleotides pair up with the **complementary** bases of the template strand  
7. mRNA is formed
8. mRNA is released
9. the DNA **rewind**
10. mRNA moves out of nucleus through **nuclear pores** into the cytoplasm

**Translation**  

Steps:
1. **ribosome** bind to the mRNA
2. **tRNA with specific amino acid and anticodon** bind to the complementary bases of the mRNA on ribosome
3. **peptide bond** is formed between adjacent amino acids
4. ribosomes **move along mRNA** and tRNA with anticodon brings more amino acids
5. repeated until ribosome reach the **stop codon**
6. polypeptide is formed and released
7. the polypeptide may **coil & fold** to form protein

</empty> | transcription | translation
--- | --- | ---
take place in | nucleus | cytoplasm
essential enzyme/protein needed | RNA polymerase | ribosome
template for production | template strand of DNA | mRNA
complementary base pairing with | bases of template strand & free ribonucleotides | codon on mRNA & anticodon on tRNA
raw materials | free ribonucleotides | amino acids
products | mRNA | polypeptides
fate of products | go to cytoplasm for translation | used in cell or secreted out, may coil & fold to form proteins

**mRNA**  
- base sequence of mRNA
	- complementary to template strand
	- same as coding strand
- function
	- for production of polypeptides
	- for translation
- production
	- in nucleus
	- by transcription
	- made from free ribonucleotides in nucleus

## Mutation
**gene mutation**  
def: changes in the **nucleotide sequence of gene** at a **molecular level**  
aka: point mutation  

types:
- deletion
	- loss of base
- insertion
	- addition of base
- substitution
	- replacement of base
- inversion
	- rotation of bases

examples:  
- sickle-cell anaemia
	- caused by substitution
	- mutation on gene that controls production of haemoglobin
	- result in abnormal haemoglobin
		- low oxygen-carrying capacity
		- may block blood vessels
		- short life span
- cystic fibrosis
	- caused by deletion of 3 bases
	- disease is recessive
	- minimal effect

**chromosome mutation**  
def: changes in the **structure or number** of **chromosomes**  

types:
- strcuture
	- duplication
	- deletion
	- inversion
	- translocation
- number
	- extra chromosome

examples:
- down syndrome
	- extra chromosome 21

gene mutation | chromsome mutation
--- | ---
change in nucleotide sequence in a gene | change of several genes of a chromosome
small scale | large scale and serious change
slight strctural change of a gene in a DNA strand | numerical or structural changes of the entire DNA strand
may be corrected | hardly corrected

**causes of mutation**  
- spontaneous mutation
- induced mutation
	- ionizing radiation
	- chemical mutagens
