## Things

- DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid
- RNA - ribonucleic acid
- tRNA - transfer RNA
- mRNA - messenger RNA
- rRNA - ribosomal RNA, used to make ribosome
- ribosome - involved in translation
- RNA polymerase - enzyme for catalysing free ribonucleotides to bind on tempalate strand
- template / non-coding / antisense strand - complementary to sequence of mRNA
- coding / sense strand - same as mRNA except T for U

## Bases

complementary pairs table  
letter | name | letter | name
--- | --- | --- | ---
A | adenine | T(DNA) / U(RNA) | thymine(DNA) / urecil(RNA)
C | cytosine | G | guanine

## Protein Synthesis

Main stages:
1. Transcription - in nucleus
2. Translation - in cytoplasm

## Transcription

Steps:
1. hydrogen bond of DNA broken
2. DNA unwind, separate into template and coding strands
3. RNA polymerase attaches to start codon of the template strand
4. RNA catalyses free ribonucleotides in nucleus
5. nucleotides attaches to the RNA polymerase as it moves from start to stop codon
6. mRNA is formed
7. mRNA is released
8. the DNA rewind
9. mRNA moves out of nucleus through nuclear pores into the cytoplasm

## Translation

Steps:
1. ribosomes bind to the mRNA
2. tRNA with specific amino acid and anticodon bind to the complementary bases of the mRNA on ribosome
3. peptide bond is formed between adjacent amino acids
4. ribosomes move along mRNA
5. polypeptide is formed
