- nostrils
	- allow air to flow into the nasal cavity
	- hairs to filter larger dust particles
- nasal cavity
	- lined with mucus-secreting cells - secret **mucus**
		- **trap** dust & bacteria => prevent entry to lungs
		- **moisten** the incoming air => reduce loss of water in lungs
	- lined with **ciliated** epithelial cells - beating action
		- **cilia sweep the mucus** with dust & germs to throat to be **swallowed or coughed out**
	- blood capillaries
		- **warm** the incoming air => maintain temperature for WBC to kill germs
	- sensory cells (olfactory cells)
		- detect chemicals in air => sensation of smell
- **pharynx**
	- is where respiratory tract & alimentary canal meet
	- epiglottis
		- prevent entry of food into trachea when swallowing
- **larynx**
	- made of cartilage
		- sypports vocal cords to prevent collapsing
	- contain **vocal cords**
		- elastic membrane vibrates => produce **sound**
		- tension of cords change pitch
	- entrance of trachea
- **trachea, bronchi, bronchioles**
	- branches
		- lower end of trachea divides into 2 bronchi (each enters a lung)
		- bronchus divides further into many bronchioles
	- ciliated epithelial cells
		- beating action - sweep mucus up to pharynx to be swallowed or coughed out
	- mucus secreting cells
		- trap dust & germs
	- C-shaped cartilage
		- prevent air tubes from collapsing
		- bronchioles have **no** cartilage
		- allow free passage of air
- air sacs (**alveoli**)
	- many at the end of brionchiole
		- many (~0.7 billion) in the lungs - large S.A.
	- highly folded
		- large S.A. for gas exchange
	- very thin wall (one-cell thick)
		- shorten distance to facilitate diffusion
	- inner surface lined moistened water film
		- dissolves oxygen before diffusion
	- richly supplied with blood capillaries
		- gases rapidly transport to & away from blood capillaries
		- large S.A. for diffusion
		- small diameter increase contact of RBC with wall of capillaries
		- close contact shorten distance for duffusion
		- receive deoxygenated blood from heart by **pulmonary artery**
		- carry oxygenated blood away from lungs by **pulmonary vein**
- rib cage
	- protects lungs
	- enclose the thoracic cavity
- **pleurae**
	- pleural membranes
		- secret pleural fluid
	- pleural cavity with **pleural fluid**
		- lubricates pleural membranes
		- reduce fruction between lungs & thoracic wall
		- if membranes punctured => air leaks in => lung collapse due to elasticity
- lungs
	- pink in color
		- filled with blood capillaries
	- spongy
		- many air sacs filled with air

## Transport of Oxygen & Carbon Dioxide

oxygen:

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\oxyhaemoglobin\xrightarrow{\tissue/\body%20\cell}\haemoglobin%2b\oxygen)

carbon dioxide:

## Mechanism of Ventilation
keys:  
- ventilation = movement of air over respiratory surface
- inspiration = inhalation = breathing in
- expiration = exhalation = breathing out
- ([ inspiration ]/[ expiration ])

1. muscles
	- diaphragm muscles (contract/relax)
	- intercoastal muscles (contract/relax)
2. structure
	- diaphragm (flattened/become dome-shaped)
	- rib cage move (upwards & outwards/downwards & inwards)
3. volume of thorax & lungs (increases/decreases)
4. air pressure inside lungs (decreases/increases)
5. air is (drawn into lungs/forced out of lungs)

**experiments**  
- **bell jar model**  
	- glass tube = trachea
	- side tube = bronchus
	- balloon = lung
	- bell jar wall = thoracic wall
	- handle & rubber sheet = diaphragm
- **rib age model**
	- rubber band = intercostal muscles
	- horizontal rods = ribs
	- outer vertical rod = sternum
	- inner vertical rod = vertebral column

## Composition of Inhaled & Exhaled Air
composition | inhaled | exhaled
--- | --- | ---
oxygen | 21% | 16%
carbon dioxide | 0.03% | 4.1%
nitrogen | 78% | 78%
other gases | 1% | 1%
water vapour | variable | saturated
temperature | variable | higher

## Lung Capacities
- tidal volume
	- amount of air entering & leaving during normal breathing
- vital capacity
	- amount of exhaled air after maximum inhalation
- residual volume
	- the amount of air left in lungs after max exhalation
- total lung capacity
	- calculated through sum of vital capacity & residual volume

## Control of Breathing
during vigorous exercise:  
1. large amount of energy needed
2. rapid rate of respiration
3. large amount of CO2 produced
4. high conc. of CO2 stimulates respiratory centre in medulla oblongata
5. sends more nerve impulses to intercostal muscles & diaphragm muscles
6. intercostal & diaphragm muscles contract more vigorously & frequently
7. higher rate & depth of breathing

after exercise:  
large amount of oxygen is still needed to oxidize lactic acid produced in anaerobic respiration

## Smoking and Health Hazards
- nicotine
	- increase heart rate & blood pressure => increase workload of heart
	- increase amount of fat deposit in blod vessels => cardiovascular disease
	- slow down transmission of nerve impulses => relaxation & addiction
- tar
	- contains carcinogens => may cause lung cancer
	- coats surfaces of alveoli => reduce S.A. for gas exchange
	- increase secretion of mucus & damage cilia => prevent sweeping upwards of mucus => bronchitis & emphysema
- carbon monoxide
	- combine with haemoglobin => prevent it from carrying oxygen
