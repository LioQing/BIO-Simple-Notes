**control the amount of light entering the eye**  
key: (*[ in dim light ]*/*[ in bright light ]*)
1. circular muscles (contract/relax) & radial muscles (relax/contract)
2. pupil (dilates/constricts)
3. (more/less) light enters the eye

**photoreceptors**  
</empty> | rod cells | cone cells
--- | --- | ---
contains | pigment visual purple | types for red, green, blue light
sensitivity to light intensity | dim light | bright light
vision | black and white | colour
distribution | none at yellow spot and blind spot | concentrated at yellow spot, none at blind spot

**eye accomodation**  
key: ([ near ]/[ distant ])
1. ciliary muscles (contract/relax)
2. suspensory ligament's tension (decreases/increases)
3. lens becomes (more/less) convex
4. lights are (more/less) converged

**eye defects**
- short-sight
	- cause: 
		- eyeball too long
		- lens too convex
	- effect: 
		- distant objects are blurred
		- can only see near objects clearly
- long-sight
	- cause: 
		- eyeball too short
		- lens too less convex
	- effect: 
		- near objects are blurred
		- can only see distant objects clearly
- colour blindness
	- cause:
		- lack of certain colour cone cell or dificiency
		- inherited
	- effect:
		- cannot distinguish colours
- astigmatism
	- cause:
		- uneven curvature of cornear or lens
	- effect:
		- vision is blurred

## Ear

**structures**:  
- pinna
	- a flap of elastic cartilage
	- collect sound waves and direct them along the auditory canal
	- helps detect direction of sound
- auditory canal
	- direct sound waves to the eardrum
- eardrum
	- thin and elastic membrane
	- convert sound waves into mechanical vibration
- ear bones
	- amplify and transmit the vibration from eardrum to the oval window
- oval window
	- flexible membrane
	- transmits the vibration to the inner ear
-  round window
	- membrane below the oval window
	- releases the fluid pressure in the cochlea to air in middle ear
- Eustachian tube
	- connects to the pharynx
	- balances the pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere
- auditory nerve
	- transmits nerve impulses from cochlea and semicircular canals to the brain
- semicircular canals
	- detect direction of head movement for keeping body balance
- cochlea
	- coiled tube with 3 canals separated by membranes
	- upper and lower canals filled with perilymph
	- central canl filled with endolymph
	- contains sensory hair cells to detect pressure changes

**mechanism of hearing**:  
- outer ear
	1. pinna collects sound waves and auditory canal directs the waves to the eardrum
	2. sound waves cause eardrum to vibrate
- middle ear
	3. ear bones amplify and transmit the vibration from eardrum to the oval window
- inner ear
	4. oval window vibrates, making the perilymph in the upper canal of cochlea to vibrate
	5. vibrations in the perilymph are transmitted to the endolymph of the central canal
	6. the hairs of sensory hair cells in the central canal bent by the vibrations, they are stimulated and send out electrical signal
	7. nerve impulses travel along the auditory nerve to the auditory centre to produce sensation of hearing
	8. vibrations in perilymph are transmitted to round window, and it bulges outwards into the middle ear to release the fluid pressure

## Tropism
def: the directional growth movement of a plant organ in response to a unilateral stimulus

types:  
</empty> | stimulus | response of root | response of shoot
--- | --- | --- | ---
hydrotropism | water | + | nil
geotropism | gravity | + | -
phototropism | light | nil/- | +
</br>

**phototropism**  
def: the directional growth movement of a plant organ in response to unlateral light  

response
- youngs hoots and leaves grow towards the unilateral light - positive phototropic
	- enables leaves to obtain the maximum amount of light for photosynthesis
- some roots grow away from the light source - negatively phototrophic
	- enables roots to grow deep underground to obtain max amount of water and minerals
	- enables plant to get better anchorage

**auxins**  
properties:  
- the most common plant growth hormone
- regulates growth and other physiological functions
- actions are non-specific - acts on most part of the plant
- produced in small amount of growing shoots and roots
- move from the tips to the region of elongation
- move away from light

graph of growht-IAA conc. for shoots and roots  
<img src="http://lungtp.com/plantsupport/auxinlevel.jpg">

image from: http://lungtp.com/plantsupport/e_ehefeb.html

comparison of the curves:
- similarities
	- conc. of auxins increase -> roots and shoots increases growth until maximum
	- once conc. exceed max -> growth slow down
- differences
	- conc. causes the greates growth on shoots, inhibits growth on roots
	- conc. that stimulates maximum root growth has no effect on shoots/stems

stimulates:  
- optimum conc. of auxin
	- root has a very low optimum conc.
	- shoot has a very high optimum conc.
- too concentrated retard the growth

**mechanism**  
1. auxins are produced at the tips of shoots/roots
2. auxins move away from light
3. higher conc. is found on the shaded side of shoot
- on shoots
	4. higher conc. stimulates growth on shaded side
	5. shaded side grow faster
	6. bend towards light
- on roots
	4. higher conc. inhibits growth on shaded side of root
	5. shaded side grow slower
	6. bends away from light
