## Importance of Osmoregulation  
- water intake
	- drinking
	- eating
	- respiration
- water loss
	- urination
	- sweating
	- exhalation
	- defaecation

when having too much or few water
- ψ cells are imbalanced
	- cells may die
	- cells may not function properly

- kidneys
	- located on the 2 sides of the vertebral column near the bottom of rib cage
	- bean-shaped
	- receive bloods from renal artery
	- drain blood by renal vein
	- produce urine for osmoregulation and excretion
- ureters
	- narrow tubes
	- carry urines produced by the kidneys to the urinary bladder
- urinary bladder
	- hollow, muscular, elastic
	- stores urine temporarily
	- exit to urethra guarded by 2 rings of sphincter muscles
		- during urination, they relax
- urethra
	- discharge urine from urinary bladder to the outside  

## Structure of Kidney

- cortex
	- the outer region
- medulla
	- the inner region
	- consists of many cone-like structures - pyramid
- pelvis
	- the central cavity
	- drains urine into the ureter
- renal artery
	- carry oxygenated blood rich in metabolic wastes
- renal vein
	- carry deoxygenated blood with less metabolic wastes


**nephrons**  
~1 million nephrons in each kidney

urine is filtrated at the following order  
1. Bowman's capsule to glomerulus
2. proximal convoluted tubule
	- coils up in the cortex
3. loop of Henle
	- extends to the medulla
4. distal convoluted tubule
	- coils up again in the cortex
5. collecting duct
	- joined to several other nephrons

blood supplies:  
- afferent arteriole
	- branches from renal artery
	- forms a spherical capillary network - glomerulus
	- enclosed by the Bowman's capsule
- efferent arteriole
	- rejoined after glomerulus
	- coils around the nephron tubules
	- eventually joined to the renal vein

**functions of nephron**  
- **ultrafiltration**
	- efferent arteriole is narrower than afferent arteriole, high blood pressure build up inside glomerulus
	- the pressure forces plasma through the thin walls of glomerular capillary and Bowman's capsule into the capsule
	- the wall of glomerulus and Bowman's capsule act as filters only permit small molecules to pass through
	- it forms a **glomerular filtrate** in the capsule
		- same as plasma except no proteins
		- no RBC, blood platelets and plasma proteins (too big)
- **reabsorption**  
	- mainly occurs in proximal convoluted tubule
	- features/adaptations for reabsorption
		- tubules are **highly coiled and long**, **increase S.A. and time**
		- wall consist of a single layer of **epithelial cells (one-cell thick)**, **shorten distance**
		- epithelia cells have **microvilli** thats in contact with the glomerular filtrate, **increase S.A.**
		- epithelial cells have **many mitochondria**, provide lots of **energy for active transport**  
		- **dense capillary network**, rapidly **transport substances away** to **maintain steep concentation gradient**
	- substances
		- glucose, amino acids 100% reabsorbed
		- salts ~80% reabsorbed
		- water 85% to 99%
			- as molecules in the filtrate reabsorbed, **ψ filtrate rises**, hence by **osmosis** returns to blood
			- ~80% is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule
		- urea 50%
			- as water is reabsorbed, urea conc. rises, hence by diffusion down the conc. gradient to blood capillaries

**table of reabsorption of different substances**
substances (percentage reabsorbed) | process(es) | proximal convoluted | loop of Henle | distal convoluted tubule | collecting duct  
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
glucose (100%) | diffusion & active transport | yes | no | no | no
amino acids (100%) | diffusion & active transport | yes | no | no | no
salts (80%) | diffusion & active transport | yes | yes | yes | yes
water (99%) | osmosis | yes | yes | yes | yes
urea (50%) | diffusion | yes | yes | yes | yes

## Role of Kidney
**osmoregulation**
- the regulation of water
- achieved by the water reabsorption

when water content too high or low  
key: ([ low ]/[ high ])  
1. ψ (decreases/increases)
2. detected by **osmoregulatory centre in the hypothalamus**
3. **pituitary gland** secret (more/less) **antidiuretic hormone (ADH)**
4. (more/less) ADH (increases/decreases) **permeability** of collecting duct
5. reabsorb (more/less) **proportion** of water
6. **(small volume of concentrated/large volume of diluted)** urine is discharged

**excretion**
- the removal of metabolic wastes
- accumulation of metabolic wastes is toxic

## Treatment of Kidney Failure
- dialysis machine
	- dialysis tubings
		- selective permeable tubings
		- provide large S.A. for rapid diffusion of wastes
	- dialysis fluid
		- same concentration as normal plasma to prevent loss of useful substances
		- same temperature as body temperature
	- haemodialysis
		- blood do not pass to the fluid
		- the fluid will be discarded but blood content in the patient will remain
	- long time needed
- kidney transplant
	- permanent treatment
	- diffculties
		- matching blood groups and tissues
		- kidney donation
