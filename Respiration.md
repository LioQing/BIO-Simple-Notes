## Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)  
consists of:  
- a nitrogenouse base (adenine)
- a 5-C sugar (ribose)
- 3 phosphate groups  

**phosphorylation** (formation):  
ADP + one phosphate group -> ATP

**hydrolysis** (release of energy):  
ATP -> ADP + phosphate + energy  

role:  
provide energy for energy-requiring activities in cells
- synthesis of biomolecules
- transmission of nerve impulse
- muscle contraction
- active transport
	- absorption of food in intestine
	- absorption of minerals by roots
- cell division

## Aerobic Respiration
def: the complete **oxidative breakdown of food** to **release energy** with the **presence of oxygen**  

stages:
1. **glycolysis** (in cytoplasm) - glucose (6-C) to pyruvate (3-C)
2. **Krebs cycle** (in matrix of mitochondrion) - pyruvate to NADH & FADH
3. **oxidative phosphorylation** (in inner membrane of mitochondrion) - NADH & FADH are oxidized to ATP in electron transport chain

## Glycolysis  
occurs in the cytoplasm

1. activation and splitting of glucose into triose phosphate
	1. glucose is stable, so needed to be activated by 2 ATP
	2. glucose splits into 2 triose phosphate
2. oxidation of one triose phosphate
	1. triosephosphate is oxidized by losing 2 hydrogen to pyruvate
	2. hydrogen atoms accepted by carrier, NAD, to NADH
	3. energy released in oxidation form 2 ATP (phosphorylation)

net change in ATP: **+2ATP**  
1 glucose -> 2 triose phosphates -> 2 pyruvates & 2NADH  

## Krebs Cycle  
occurs in the mitochondrial matrix

1. pruvate diffuses into mitochondrial matrix from cytoplasm
	1. pyruvate loses 1 CO2 molecule
	2. 2 hydrogen atoms are accepted by NAD to NADH
	3. acetyl group (2-C) combines with a carrier, coenzyme A, to acetyl-CoA
2. in cycle in the mitochondrial matrix
	1. acetyl-CoA combines with a 4-C compound to 6-C compound, CoA is regenerated
	2. regeneration of 4-C compound
		1. 2 CO2 are released (decarboxylation)
		2. 4 pairs of hydrogen atoms accepted by 3NAD to 3NADH and 1FAD to 1FADH (dehydrogenation)
		3. 1ATP is produced

net change of molecules (including krebs cycle and prep for krebs cycle):  
- +4NADH
- +3CO2
- +1FADH
- +1ATP

1 pyruvate -> acetyle-CoA -> (enters krebs cycle) 6-C compound -> 4-C compound -> ...  

## Oxidative Phosphorylation  
occurs in the inner membrane of mitochondrion

1. during oxidation NADH & FADH loses hydrogen, NAD & FAD are regenerated
2. hydrogen dissociate into hydrogen ions and electrons
3. electrons pass along electron transport chain, series of redox reactions occur
4. energy released during oxidation used to synthesis ATP from ADP & phosphate
5. electrons & hydrogen accepted by oxygen (final hydrogen acceptor) to form water  

in electron transport chain: 
- each pair of electrons from NADH form 3ATP
- each FADH oxidized, form 2ATP

if no oxygen available:  
1. NAD & FAD cannot be regenerated
2. glycolysis cannot proceed because no hydrogen carrier

## Anaerobic Respiration
def: the breakdown of food to release energy without oxygen  

stages:
1. glycolysis
2. regeneration of NAD

## Alcoholic Fermentation
1. pyruvate loses CO2 to form a 2-C compound (ethanal)
2. ethanal act as final hydrogen acceptor to regenerate NAD from NADH
3. product is ethanal
4. most energy is trapped in ethanal, 2ATP are formed

## Lactic Acid Fermentation
1. pyruvate from glycolysis acts as a final hydrogen acceptor to regenerate NAD from NADH
2. product is lactic acid / lactate
3. no CO2 is produced
4. most energy is trapped in lactate, 2ATP are formed

## Anaerobic Respiration in Muscles
- great demand of energy during vigorous exercises
- extra energy within short period of time
- lactic acid in blood
- **muscles fatigue** by accumulation of lactic acid
- **oxygen debt**, extra amount of oxygen needed for removal of lactic acid
