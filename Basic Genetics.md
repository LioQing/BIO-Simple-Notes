long chain of nucleotides, each consist of a phosphate group, 5-carbon sugar, nitrogenous base  
it forms a polynucleotide

## Terms

**Gene**:  
the basic hereditary unit which consists of a short length of DNA, which determines the development of certain cahracteristic  

**Alleles**:  
genes can exist in 2 or more alternative forms called alleles, alleles are usually formed by mutations  

**Locus**:  
the location on a chromosome where the gene is located  

**Geotype**:  
the genetic composition of an organism, e.g. TT, tt, Tt  

**Phenotype**:  
the observable characteric of an organism  

**Homozygote**:  
an organism with 2 identical alleles for a particular characteristic  

**Heterozygote**:  
an organism with 2 different alleles for a particular characteristic  

**Dominant allele**:  
can express its effect in both homozygotes and heterozygotes, represented by capital letter, e.g. T for tall plants  

**Recessive allele**:  
cannot express its effect in heterozygote, only effective in homozygote, represented by lower case letter, e.g. t for short plants
