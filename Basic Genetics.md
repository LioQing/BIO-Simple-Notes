## Terms

**Gene**:  
the basic hereditary unit which consists of a short length of DNA, which determines the development of certain cahracteristic  

**Alleles**:  
genes can exist in 2 or more alternative forms called alleles, alleles are usually formed by mutations  

**Locus**:  
the location on a chromosome where the gene is located  

**Geotype**:  
the genetic composition of an organism, e.g. TT, tt, Tt  

**Phenotype**:  
the observable characteric of an organism  

**Homozygote**:  
an organism with 2 identical alleles for a particular characteristic  

**Heterozygote**:  
an organism with 2 different alleles for a particular characteristic  

**Dominant allele**:  
can express its effect in both homozygotes and heterozygotes, represented by capital letter, e.g. T for tall plants  

**Recessive allele**:  
cannot express its effect in heterozygote, only effective in homozygote, represented by lower case letter, e.g. t for short plants  

**Monohybrid inheritance**:  
the inheritance of characteristics controlled by a single gene  

result:
- both parents are homozygous of different alleles  
	- all dominant  
	- all heterozygous	
- both parents are heterozygous
	- dominant : recessive allele = 3:1
	- dominant homozygous = 25%  
	- dominant heterozygous = 50%  
	- recessive homozygous = 25% 

**Mandel's First Law of Inheritance (Law of Segregation)**  
def: 2 alleles of a certain locus segregate or separate into separate gametes  

in Mandel's model of inheritance:  
- an offspring receive 1 allele from each parent  
- the alleles received is the result of Law of Segregation of its parents  
- dominant allele's character shown if it is present in the alleles of the offspring  
- recessive allele's character shown if no dominant allele present

examples (dominant & recessive):  
- maize
	- dark & white grains in cob  
- fruit fly
	- long & vestigial wings
	- red & white eyes
- mouse
	- black & brown hair  
	- normal & short ears  
- humans
	- v-shaped & straight hairline
	- dark & blond hairs
	- brown & blue eyes
	- free & attached earlobes
	- straight & curved thumb

**Dihybrid inheritance**  
the inheritance of 2 characteristics controlled by 2 separate genes  

**Mandel's Second Law of Inheritance (Law of Independent Assortment)**  
def: a pair of allele may assort or combine independently with another pair of allele  

**Punnett square**  

*punnett square for monohybrid inheritance of 2 purebred parents of different alleles*

T: dominant allele  
t: recessive allele

genotype => phenotype:  
- TT => T
- Tt => T
- tt => t  

phenotype of T:t = 3:1

R: dominant (round)  
r: recessive (wrinkled)  

Y: dominant (yellow)  
y: recessive (green)

T: tall (dominant)  
t: short (recessive)

F2 result:  
- tall to short phenotype ratio = 3:1  
- tall homozygous 25%  
- tall heterozygous 50%  
- short homozygous 25%  

**Multiple alleles**  
ABO blood groups: controlled by 3 forms of alleles  

relationships:  
- A is dominant to O
- B is dominant to O
- A and B are **co-dominant**  

genotypes | phenotype | antigen on RBC | antibodies in serum  
--- | --- | --- | ---
AA, AO | A | antigen A | anti-B
BB, BO | B | antigen B | anti-A
AB | AB | antigen A & antigen B | none
OO | O | none | anti-A & anti-B

**Co-dominant**  
2 alleles can express its characteristics at the same time  

**sex-chromosomes**  
male: XY  
female: XX  

**sex-linked alleles**  
the locus of the gene is located on sex-chromosomes  
=> percentage of certain sex-linked genetic disorder of different gender is different  

## Types of Vaitaions  

**continuous vairation**  
def: variation is not clear cut, it has continuous range of intermediate forms between 2 extremes  

features:  
- no. of individuals plotted against characteristics forms a series of histograms
- join the mid-pt of histograms to produce a normal distribution curve

examples:  
- animals
	- height
	- weight
	- hand span
	- rate of heartbeat
	- skin colour
	- body form
	- intelligence quotient
	- milk production
	- egg production
- plants
	- size of leaves
	- shape of leaves

remarks:  
- partially affected by the env.
- partially inherited  

**discontinuous variation**  
def: variation is very clearly cut with n ointermediates  

examples:  
- animals
	- tongue rolling
	- tasting PTC papers
	- earlobe
	- eye colour
	- wing form
	- coat colour
- plants
	- height in some plants
	- colour of certain flowers
	- shape of seeds in pea

remarks:  
- not easily affected by env.
- usually controlled by 1 pair of genes

**causes of variations**  
- genetics factors
	- hereditary information
		- crossing over in the same chromosomes at meiosis
		- independent assortment of chromosomes at meiosis
		- random fertilization
	- mutation
		- spontaneous mutation
		- radiation
- environmental factors
	- environemnts
		- body weight
		- intelligence
	- light
		- colour of leaves
	- temperature
		- fur colour of humalayan rabbit
		- wing of fruit fly
