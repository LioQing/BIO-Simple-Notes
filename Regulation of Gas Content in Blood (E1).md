## Importance of Regulation Gas Content in Blood
- supply of oxygen
	- oxygen needed for respiration
	- constant supply of oxygen by blood from lungs
- removal of carbon dioxide
	- accumulation of carbon dioxide will decrease the pH of blood
	- low pH will affect enzymes and hence metabolic activities
- control
	- rate and depth of breathing
	- cardiac output

## Control Mechanism of Breathing
regular breathing is an involuntary reflex  
controlled by **respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata**  

regular breathing:  
1. inspiratory part of respiratory centre => nerve impulses => motor nerves => intercostal muscles & diaphragm muscles contract => inspiration (inhalation)
2. inspiratory activities inflates lungs => stimulate stretch receptors => nerve impulses => sensory nerves => inspiratory part of respiratory centre
3. nerve impulses **automatically** inhibit the inspiratory part of respiratory centre => no nervouse stimulation => respiratory muscles & intercostal muscles relaxes => expiration (exhalation)
4. expiration makes lungs deflate => stretch receptors no longer stimulated => no nerve impulses => inspiration part of respiratory centre free from inhibition => inspiration occur again

measurement of breathing:  
- **rate of breathing**
- **depth of breathing**  

controlling breathing by **negative feedback emchanism**    
key: ([ CO2 rises ]/[ CO2 drops ])
1. CO2 conc. (rises/drops)
2. (drops/rises) of pH of blood detected by chemoreceptors in aortic and carotid bodies
3. (drops/rises) of pH of cerebrospinal fluid detected by chemoreceptros in respiratory centre
4. send nerve impulses from respiratory centre
5. (faster & stronger/slower & weaker) contraction of intercostal muscles & diaphragm muscles
6. rate and depth of breathing (increase/decrease)
7. CO2 conc. (drops/rises)

## Cardiac Cycle  
stage (time)
1. atrial systole (0s - 0.1s)
	- atria contract
	- force blood through tricuspid and bicuspid valves to ventricles
2. ventricular systole (0.1s - 0.4s)
	- ventricles contract
	- blood pressure increase to close tricuspid and bicuspid valves to prevent backflow of blood
	- high blood pressure opens semilunar valves and force blood into aorta and pulmonary arteries
	- closure of tricuspid and bicuspid valves produce first heart sound 'lub'
3. diastole (0.4s - 0.8s)
	- atria and vectricles relax
	- atria receive blood from vena cavae and pulmonary vein
	- closure of semilunar valves produce second heart sound 'dub'

process to initiate a heart beat
1. **sinoatrial node (SA node) (pacemaker)** located on the wall of right atrium automatically generate electrical impulses, and both atria contract
2. electrical impulses from SA node travel to **atrioventricular node (AV node)** located on the wall between right atrium and right ventricle
3. AV node relays the impulses to both ventricles and causes them to contract

**cardiac output**  
- stoke volume
- heart rate

cardiac output (mL/min) = stoke volume (mL/beat) * heart rate (beats/min)

**hormonal control**  
1. CO2 conc. in blood rises
2. blood pressure and pH rises
3. **cardio-acceleratory centre** send nerve impulses along **sympathetic nerve** to adrenal glands
4. adrenal glands secrete more adrenaline
5. adrenaline stimulate cardiac muscles to increase the cardiac output by beating faster and stronger  

**nervous control**  
key: ([ CO2 conc. drops ]/[ CO2 conc. rise ])
1. blood CO2 conc. (drops/rises)
2. blood pH and pressure changed
	- blood pH (rises/drops)
	- blood pressure (rises/drops)
3. receptors are stimualated
	- chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and aortic bodies stimulated by (high/low) pH
	- stretch receptors in the aorta and carotid arteries are stimulated by (high/low) blood pressure
4. (**cardio-inhibitory centre/cardio-acceleratory centre**) receive impulses from receptors
5. nerve impulses are sent along (**parasympathetic/sympathetic**) nerves to SA node to increase the heart rate & stroke volume
6. (decreases/increases) CO2 delivered to the lungs for removal & blood pressure  

## Oxygen Debt  
production of extra energy within a **short period of time** by **anaerobic respiration**  
causes: lack of oxygen  
produces: lactic acid  
process: **lactic acid fermentation**  

to repay the oxygen debt  
work: breathe rapidly  
effects: more oxygen is intake for almost 50 mins  

lactic acid accumulation  
effects: tired, pain, convulsion in muscle - **muscle fatigue**  

recommended activity after vigorous exercise - **slow jogging**
- running increases rate of breathing and heartbeat
- increase the amount of oxygen taken into the lungs
- increases the blood flow to deliver more oxygen to liver
