## Importance of Regulation Gas Content in Blood
- supply of oxygen
	- oxygen needed for respiration
	- constant supply of oxygen by blood from lungs
- removal of carbon dioxide
	- accumulation of carbon dioxide will decrease the pH of blood
	- low pH will affect enzymes and hence metabolic activities
- control
	- rate and depth of breathing
	- cardiac output

## Control Mechanism of Breathing
regular breathing is an involuntary reflex  
controlled by **respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata**  

regular breathing:  
1. inspiratory part of respiratory centre => nerve impulses => motor nerves => intercostal muscles & diaphragm muscles contract => inspiration (inhalation)
2. inspiratory activities inflates lungs => stimulate stretch receptors => nerve impulses => sensory nerves => inspiratory part of respiratory centre
3. nerve impulses **automatically** inhibit the inspiratory part of respiratory centre => no nervouse stimulation => respiratory muscles & intercostal muscles relaxes => expiration (exhalation)
4. expiration makes lungs deflate => stretch receptors no longer stimulated => no nerve impulses => inspiration part of respiratory centre free from inhibition => inspiration occur again

measurement of breathing:  
- **rate of breathing**
- **depth of breathing**  

controlling breathing by **negative feedback emchanism**    
key: ([ CO2 rises ]/[ CO2 drops ])
1. CO2 conc. (rises/drops)
2. (drops/rises) of pH of blood detected by chemoreceptors in aortic and carotid bodies
3. (drops/rises) of pH of cerebrospinal fluid detected by chemoreceptros in respiratory centre
4. send nerve impulses from respiratory centre
5. (faster & stronger/slower & weaker) contraction of intercostal muscles & diaphragm muscles
6. rate and depth of breathing (increase/decrease)
7. CO2 conc. (drops/rises)

## Cardiac Cycle  
stage (time)
1. atrial systole (0s - 0.1s)
	- atria contract
	- force blood through tricuspid and bicuspid valves to ventricles
2. ventricular systole (0.1s - 0.4s)
	- ventricles contract
	- blood pressure increase to close tricuspid and bicuspid valves to prevent backflow of blood
	- high blood pressure opens semilunar valves and force blood into aorta and pulmonary arteries
	- closure of tricuspid and bicuspid valves produce first heart sound 'lub'
3. diastole (0.4s - 0.8s)
	- atria and vectricles relax
	- atria receive blood from vena cavae and pulmonary vein
	- closure of semilunar valves produce second heart sound 'dub'

process to initiate a heart beat
1. **sinoatrial node (SA node) (pacemaker)** located on the wall of right atrium automatically generate electrical impulses, and both atria contract
2. electrical impulses from SA node travel to **atrioventricular node (AV node)** located on the wall between right atrium and right ventricle
3. AV node relays the impulses to both ventricles and causes them to contract

**cardiac output**  
- stoke volume
- heart rate

cardiac output (mL/min) = stoke volume (mL/beat) * heart rate (beats/min)
