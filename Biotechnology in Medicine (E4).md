## Production of Pharmaceutical Products  

- ***human insulin***  
	- less side-effects 
		- ***amino acid sequence*** is same as human insulin
		- other animal insulin has slightly different amino acid sequence
	- high reproductive rate of bacteria give ***high yield***
	- continuous growth enables insulin to be ***produced continuously***
	- ***simpler and cheaper*** purification process
- ***human growth hormone***
	- cure ***dwarfism***
	- conventional method - extract from pituitary glands of dead people
		- expensive
		- scarce
		- may contaminated with infectrous proteins
	- new method - recombinant technology
		- low price
		- pure and safe
- vaccine
	- conventional vaccines - from treated pathogens to develop immunity inside human
		- some vaccines cannot be produced easily
		- some vaccines have ill effects
	- ***recombinant vaccines*** - from recombinant technology
		- can be produced in large scale at low cost
		- safer, would not cause virus to become active and cause disease again
		- examples
			- influenza
			- hepatitis B virus
			- malaria
- ***monoclonal antibodies***
	- stimulate B cells with specific antigen and fuse with a tumour cell to produce a cell to produce the specific antibodies indefinitely
	- medical diagnosis for ***cancer cells, pathogens, home pregnancy test***
	- ***cancer treatment*** to link substances or toxins on cancer cells to destroy them
	- ***transplant surgery*** to ***prevent rejection*** of tranplanted tissue by attacking T cells

bacteria's role:  
- easy manipulation
- easily cultured
- high production
- low cost

## Gene Therapy
to treat malfunctioning proteins
- cystic fibrosis
- sicke-cell anemia
- haemophilia
- musuclar dystrophy  

***in vivo gene therapy***  
1. viruses carrying the therapeutic gene introced to the patient's body
2. viruses insert therapeutic gene into target cells

***ex vivo gene therapy***  
1. insert ***therapeutic gene*** into ***vector*** e.g. virus
2. ***remove target cells*** out of patient's body and grow in culture
3. add viruses to ***insert therapeutic gene into target cells***
4. ***select*** and culture the transformed cells
5. ***re-introduce*** the transformed cells back into patient's body by ***injection***
6. expression of therapeutic gene in transformed cells ***produces functional proteins***  

types:  
- somatic cell gene therapy
	- transferred to somatic cells (body cells)
	- cannot be inherited to the offspring

benefits:  
- genetic disorder
- gene with protective functions
- germ line gene therapy targeting reproductive cells

harzards:  
- in vivo gene therapy
	- viral vector may ***regain ability to cause diseases***
	- viruses insert genes at ***random locations*** may cause mutations
	- viruses may trigger ***immune response*** of the body
- somatic gene therapy
	- ***repeated treatments*** is needed and increase exposure to above harzards
- ***very expensive***
- ***designer babies***
- genetic screening of unborn babies leading to ***abortion***  

## Stem Cells Therapy

stem cells' properties:  
- unspecialized cells
- divide indefinitely by mitosis
- differentiate into other types

</empty> | embryonic stem cells | adult stem cells
--- | --- | ---
origin | early embryo | adult tissue (e.g. bone marrow)
cell types formed | wide range of cell types | limited range of cell types
grow in culture | can grow and divide in culture for more than a year without differentiation | difficult to isolate from tissue and difficult to grow in culture
immune responses | may induce immune responses | stem cells from the patient's own cell less likely to rejected by immune system
ethical concerns | more, embryo will be killed | less, not collected from embryo so no life is killed
