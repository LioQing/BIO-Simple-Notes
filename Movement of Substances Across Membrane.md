## Phospholipid Bilayer
- head
    - hydrophilic
- tail
    - hydrophobic/non-polar
    - permeable to lipid-soluble substances
    - permits small non-polar molecules (O2 and CO2)

## Protein Molecules
- Channel proteins or carrier proteins
    - permeable to water molecules, ions and water-soluble substances

## Substances that Cannot Pass Through Cell Membrane
- Bigger than space between the phospholipid molecules
- Bigger than hydrophilic pores of the channel proteins
- Do not fit into the receptor sites of the carrier proteins

## Mosaic Fluid Model
supports the selective permeability of the cell membrane

## Ways of Movement of Different Substances Across Cell Membrane
- Diffusion
- Osmosis
- Active transport
- Phagocytosis

## Diffusion
is the net movement of particles  down the concentration gradient until the concentration of particles is in equilibrium

Features:
- No metabolic energy is needed
- Diffusion is reversible (can move in opposite directions)
- Occurs passively without the need of specific carriers
- Involves movement of gases, ions, and small polar molecules across the cell membrane

Speed of diffusion is faster when:
- higher concentration gradient
- shorter distance
- larger surface area
- higher temperature
- smaller size of particle
- lipid-soluble molecues across cell membrane
- dilute medium (gaseous > liquid)
- greater number and size of pores in membrane

## Osmosis
is the diffusion of water molecules

Terms:
- Water potential
    - the tendency of water molecules to move
- Pure water
    - Highest water concentration and water potential
- Solute
    - The presence of solute particles lower the water potential

Importance:
- In human
    - absorption and reabsorption of water
- In plants
    - absorption of water from soil
    - movement of water from cell to cell
    - maintenance of turgid support in herbaceous stems and seedlings

## Active Transport
is the movement of particles against a concentration gradient

Mechanism:
- Involves a carrier protein
    1. The substance attached to the biding site of the carrier protein
    2. With the release of energy from ATP the carrier protein changes its shape
    3. The substance is then released into the cell

Factors:
- High temperature => high KE for enzymatic reactions
- High concentration of oxygen => high rate of aerobic respiration
- Factors that reduce the rate of respiration will slow or stop the active transport
    - Shortage of oxygen
    - Metabolic poison

Importance:
- Allow cells to take up nutrients when the concentration outside is low
    - Villi of small intestine actively absorb nutrients
    - Root hair actively absorb mineral salts
    - Relative concentration of different ions in the cell sap of green alga are higher, because actively absorbed from surrounding pond water
    - Kidney tubules actively reabsorb useful substances
- Allow cells to get rid of unwanted substances

## Phagocytosis
is the process which the cell engulfs particles that are too big to pass into the cell by other means (aka cell-eating)

Process:
1. Cell membrane fold inwards to form a pit to enclose the particle, sealing off to form a vacuole
2. The cytoplasm discharge enzymes into the vacuole to break down the particles, digesting products into surrounding cytoplasm

Importance:
- Body defence
    - Phagoctyes can engulf harmful microorganisms
- Feeding
    - Unicellular organisms such as Amoeba can produce pseudopodia around a food particle to form a food vacuole

## Daily Application of Diffusion and Osmosis
- Food preservation
    - Kill microoragnisms in food bu putting strong salf or sugar solution to remove water from food by osmosis
- Kidney machine
    - To help patients with removal of wastes from body by diffusion
- Water purifier
