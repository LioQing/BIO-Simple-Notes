## Leaf  

Features | Adaptation
--- | ---
Broad and flat shape | provide max S.A. to absorb more light and CO2 for photosynthesis  
Thinness shortens the distance | gaseous diffuse rapidly and light penetrates easily to the mesophyll cells to enhance gas exchange and photosynthesis  
Palisade mesophyll cells are closely packed with many chloroplasts at the upper part of the leaf | absorb light more efficiently to carry out photosynthesis
Spongy mesolphyll cells are lossely packed with many large air spaces but fewer chloroplasts | permit rapid diffusion of gases to enhance gas exchange  
More stomata on lower epidermis | permit rapid gas exchange with the atmosphere
Each stoma is srrounded by a pair of guard cells | control the opening and closing of the stoma to regulate the passage of gases and water vapour in and out of the leaf
Extensive network of bein system | Xylem transports water and mineral salts to the mesophyll and support the shape of the leaf for efficient light absorption; phloem transports food produced out of the leaf
Waxy cuticle | reduces water loss from the large leaf surface

## Chloroplast
- Double membrane
	- Inner membrane
		- extends inward to form thylakoid
	- Outer membrane
		- regulate the passage of materials in and out
- Thylakoid
	- Granum
		- stack of thylakoid
		- increase surface are to pack more chlorophyll
	- Intergranal thylakoid
		- grana connected to each other by intergranal thylakoid
		- increase efficient transport of photosynthetic products
- Stroma
	- site of carbon fixation
	- contains starch grain for storage of photosynthetic products

## Mechanism

6CO2 + 24H2O 	===light==in chloroplast===>	C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 18H2O  
  
carbon dioxide + water 	===light==in chloroplast===>	sugars + oxygen + water  

## Photochemical Reaction  

**Phosphorylation**  
to produce ATP

1. **cholorophyll** in the thylakoid **absorbs light** => emit **excited elctrons**
2. excited elctrons pass down an **electron transport chain** => **ATP** is produced by **adding a phosphate group**  

ADP + P ===energy===> ATP  

**Photolysis of Water**  

1. **chlorophyll absorbed light energy** to **split water** into H and O
2. **H is accepted by NADP** to form **NADPH** => NADPH will act as a reducing agent to **donate hydrogen to fix CO2** in dark stage
3. **O is released as a by-product** into the atmosphere
