## Leaf  

Features | Adaptation
--- | ---
Broad and flat shape | provide max S.A. to absorb more light and CO2 for photosynthesis  
Thinness shortens the distance | gaseous diffuse rapidly and light penetrates easily to the mesophyll cells to enhance gas exchange and photosynthesis  
Palisade mesophyll cells are closely packed with many chloroplasts at the upper part of the leaf | absorb light more efficiently to carry out photosynthesis
Spongy mesolphyll cells are lossely packed with many large air spaces but fewer chloroplasts | permit rapid diffusion of gases to enhance gas exchange  
More stomata on lower epidermis | permit rapid gas exchange with the atmosphere
Each stoma is srrounded by a pair of guard cells | control the opening and closing of the stoma to regulate the passage of gases and water vapour in and out of the leaf
Extensive network of bein system | Xylem transports water and mineral salts to the mesophyll and support the shape of the leaf for efficient light absorption; phloem transports food produced out of the leaf
Waxy cuticle | reduces water loss from the large leaf surface

## Chloroplast

<img src="images/photosynthesis%20-%20chloroplast.png">

- Double membrane
	- Inner membrane
		- extends inward to form thylakoid
	- Outer membrane
		- regulate the passage of materials in and out
- Thylakoid
	- Granum
		- stack of thylakoid
		- increase surface are to pack more chlorophyll
	- Intergranal thylakoid
		- grana connected to each other by intergranal thylakoid
		- increase efficient transport of photosynthetic products
- Stroma
	- site of carbon fixation
	- contains starch grain for storage of photosynthetic products

## Mechanism

6CO2 + 24H2O 	===light==in chloroplast===>	C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 18H2O  
  
carbon dioxide + water 	===light==in chloroplast===>	sugars + oxygen + water  

## Photochemical Reaction  

**Phosphorylation**  
to produce ATP

1. **cholorophyll** in the thylakoid **absorbs light** => emit **excited elctrons**
2. excited elctrons pass down an **electron transport chain** => **ATP** is produced by **adding a phosphate group**  

ADP + P ===energy===> ATP  

**Photolysis of Water**  

1. **chlorophyll absorbed light energy** to **split water** into H and O
2. **H is accepted by NADP** to form **NADPH** => NADPH will act as a reducing agent to **donate hydrogen to fix CO2** in dark stage
3. **O is released as a by-product** into the atmosphere

## Calvin Cycle

from: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/photosynthesis/a/calvin-cycle

1\. **Carbon Fixation**  
1. **CO2** **combines** with a **5-C compound** (a CO2 acceptor) to fix the CO2
2. this results in a **6-C compound** (unstable) which immediately splits into **2 3-C compounds** (stable)

2\. **Reduction to Triose Phosphate**
1. **3-C compound** is **reduced by NADPH to triose phosphate** with energy provided by **ATP** (from photochemcial reactions)
2. the **ADP and NADP** formed will be **reused** in photochemical reactions

3\. **Regeneration of CO2 acceptor (5-C compound)**
1. majority of **triose phosphate** are **regenerated to CO2 acceptor** with energy provided by **ATP**
2. the **continuouse supply of CO2 acceptor** for carbon fixation ensures the **cyclic process**

## Conversion of Triose Phosphate into other Biomolecules

- carbohydrates
	- **glucose** - easily oxidized to **release energy**
	- **sucrose** - **soluble and inactive** for **transport**
	- **starch** - **large and insoluble** for **reserve**
	- **cellulose** - for main **structureal material** of cell wall
- lipids
	- **fatty acids** - **intermediate formed in glycolysis** when 1 3-C compund entering glycolysis of respiration
	- **glycerol** - from triose phosphate
	- BOTH are for **forming cell membrane and energy reserve**
- proteins
	- **amino acids** - formed when 1 C-3 compound entering Krebs cycle from Calvin cycle **combines with minerals**
	- **proteins** - formed by joining amino acids
	- for forming **cell membrane, enzymes, repair and growth**

## Environmental Factors

**Concept: Limiting Factor**  
when change of a factor is supposed to increase the photosynthetic rate  
but the photosynthetic rate **leveled off**  
**other factor(s) becomes the limiting factor**  
limiting the photosynthetic rate regardless of the change of this factor

**Light Intensity**
