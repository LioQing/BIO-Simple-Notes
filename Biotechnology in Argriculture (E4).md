## Transgenic Plants

- pest-resistant ***BT crop*** plants
	- ***BT gene*** inserted into crop plants
	- saves use of pesticides => ***reduce pollution***
- ***herbicide-resistant*** crop plants
	- herbicide kills weed
	- herbicide-resistant gene inserted into crop plants => they can ***withstand the toxic effect***
- ***disease-resistant*** crop plants
	- produce anti-viral proteins or antifungal proteins
	- develop resistance against virus or fungi
- crop plants ***tolerant to adverse env.*** conditions
	- gene for tolerance to cold, drought, high salinity
- improved ***quality***
	- tomato plants gene to stop production of a plant hormone to ***delay soften*** of tissues
	- increase content of red pigment of tomato, helps people to be healthier
- improved ***nutritional value***
	- ***golden rice*** with rich carotene, a precursor of ***vitamin A***
	- GM crops like soybeans & canola with high content of 'good' lipids to reduce risk of heart disease
	- potatoes with more protein content

## Transgenic Animals

- transgenic ***salmon***
	- rapid growth by producing ***growth hormone***
	- resistance to cold
- transgenic livestock
	- transgenic cows ***growth hormone***, BST, ***grow faster, less fat, more milk***
	- transgenic pigs with ***leaner meat, fewer fats***
	- transgenic goats to ***produce lactse-free milk***, less 'bad' fats

## Scientific Research  

- study functions of genes
- trasngenic ***mice*** as model for study of disease
	- shorter time
	- lower cost
	- high genetic similarities with humans
	- close physiological conditions to humans
- toxicity tests
- transgenic organs
