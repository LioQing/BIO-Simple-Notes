## Food Substances
required in larger amount

- carbohydrates
	- glucose
		- oxidized to release energy
		- affects water potential
	- glycogen
		- storage form of carbohydrates in liver
		- stored in muscles as energy reserve
	- cellulose
		- acts as dietary fibre to stimulate peristalsis
- lipids
	- energy reserve (release x2 energy of carbohydrate)
	- insulating layer
		- fatty tissues (e.g. subcutaneous fats)
	- shock absorber
		- around heart and kidneys
	- organic solvent
		- carry lipids-soluble vitamins (A and D)
	- structural materials
- proteins
	- structural materials
		- growth and repair
	- metabolic regulators
		- enzymes
		- hormones
		- haemoglobin
	- antibodies to act against antigens/germs
	- energy reserve (only broken down under extreme starvation)

## Vitamins
required in small amounts

vitamin | main sources | deficiency disease
--- | --- | ---
A (lipid-soluble) | fish liver oil, liver, butter, milk, egg, green vegetables, carrot | night-blindness
C (water-soluble) | citrus fruits, vegetables | scurvy
D (lipid-soluble) | fish liver oil, milk, butter, egg, fish | rickets, osteoporosis

## Minerals
no energy value, build up tissues or regulate metabolic activities

minerals | main sources | function | deficiency disease
--- | --- | --- | ---
calcium | milk, cheese, vegetables, dairy products | form bone & teeth, blood clotting, muscle contraction | rickets, osteoporosis, bleeding
iron | liver, kidney, meat, green vegetables, yeast, egg | component of haemoglobin | anaemia
magnesium | green vegetables, low-fat dairy products | regulate biochemical reactions, protein synthesis, muscle, nerve, blood glucose | diabetes, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis
potassium | fruits and vegetables | regulate fluid pressure, muscle and heart contraction | osteoporosis, kidney stone

## Dietary Fibres
not a nutrient, mainly consist of cellulose in cell wall

functions:
- make food more bulky
- stimulate peristalsis
- deficiency causes egestion very difficult

## Proper Diet

### Factors of Energy Need
- age
- sex
- pregnancy
- activities

### Health Problems from Improper Diet
- under-nutrition
	- protein deficiency disease (Kwashiorkor)
	- eating disorders
		- under-weight
		- anorexia nervosa
- over-nutrition
	- obesity
	- diet rich in lean meat
		- unbalanced
		- over protein metabolism

## Processes of Nutrition in Humans
- ingestion
	- the intake of food through mouth into the alimentary canal
- digestion
	- the breakdown of food into simpler and soluble molecules
- absorption
	- the update of digested, small, soluble food molecules into the circulatory system
- assimilation
	- the usage of absorbed food by the body cells for metabolism
- eggestion (defaecation)
	- the removal of undigested and unabsorbed food from the gut as *faeces*

## Digestive System of Humans

<img src="https://github.com/LioQing/BIO-Simple-Notes/blob/master/images/nutrition%20in%20humans%20-%20digestive%20system.png">  

**alimentary canal**  
def: the long tube running from mouth to the anus in digestive system  

parts and their functions:  
1. mouth cavity
	- ingestino
	- mechanical/physical digestion
	- chemical digestion of starch
2. pharynx
	- swallowing
3. oesophagus
	- passage for food
4. stomach
	- mechanical/physcial digestion
	- chemical digestion of proteins
5. small intestine (duodenum, ileum)
	- digestion
	- absorption
6. large intestine (caecum, appendix, colon, rectum)
	- further absorption of water
	- storage of faeces
7. anus
	- egestion

**digestive glands**  

digestive glands | digestive juices | sites of action
--- | --- | ---
salivary glands (around mouth cavity) | saliva | mouth cavity
gastric glands (in stomach wall) | gastric juice | stomach
liver | bile (stored in gall bladder) | duodenum
pancreas | pancreatic juice | duodenum
intestinal glands (in intestinal wall) | intestinal juice | small intestine

### Ingestion

**tooth**
<img src="https://github.com/LioQing/BIO-Simple-Notes/blob/master/images/nutrition%20in%20humans%20-%20tooth.png">  

types:
- incisors
	- location
		- front of jaw
	- features
		- chisel-shaped
		- sharp edged
		- one root
	- function
		- biting food
		- cutting food
- canines
	- location
		- next to incisors
	- features
		- curved and pointed
		- one root
		- in canivores are developed for killing preys to prevent escape
	- function
		- tearing flesh
- premolars
	- location
		- at the sides of each jaw behind incisors
	- features
		- broad top with cusps
		- one or two roots
	- function
		- crushing food
		- grinding food
- molars
	- location
		- behind the premolar
	- features
		- similar to premolars but larger
		- two or three roots
	- function
		- same as premolars

**dental fomulat**  
def: the expression to show the number of each type of teeth at each side of the upper and lower jaws

1st to 4th numbers are:
1. incisors
2. canines
3. premolars
4. molars
