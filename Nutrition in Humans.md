## Food Substances
required in larger amount

- carbohydrates
	- glucose
		- oxidized to release energy
		- affects water potential
	- glycogen
		- storage form of carbohydrates in liver
		- stored in muscles as energy reserve
	- cellulose
		- acts as dietary fibre to stimulate peristalsis
- lipids
	- energy reserve (release x2 energy of carbohydrate)
	- insulating layer
		- fatty tissues (e.g. subcutaneous fats)
	- shock absorber
		- around heart and kidneys
	- organic solvent
		- carry lipids-soluble vitamins (A and D)
	- structural materials
- proteins
	- structural materials
		- growth and repair
	- metabolic regulators
		- enzymes
		- hormones
		- haemoglobin
	- antibodies to act against antigens/germs
	- energy reserve (only broken down under extreme starvation)

## Vitamins
required in small amounts

vitamin | main sources | deficiency disease
--- | --- | ---
A (lipid-soluble) | fish liver oil, liver, butter, milk, egg, green vegetables, carrot | night-blindness
C (water-soluble) | citrus fruits, vegetables | scurvy
D (lipid-soluble) | fish liver oil, milk, butter, egg, fish | rickets, osteoporosis

## Minerals
no energy value, build up tissues or regulate metabolic activities

minerals | main sources | function | deficiency disease
--- | --- | --- | ---
calcium | milk, cheese, vegetables, dairy products | form bone & teeth, blood clotting, muscle contraction | rickets, osteoporosis, bleeding
iron | liver, kidney, meat, green vegetables, yeast, egg | component of haemoglobin | anaemia
magnesium | green vegetables, low-fat dairy products | regulate biochemical reactions, protein synthesis, muscle, nerve, blood glucose | diabetes, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis

## Dietary Fibres
not a nutrient, mainly consist of cellulose in cell wall

functions:
- make food more bulky
- stimulate peristalsis
- deficiency causes egestion very difficult

## Factors of Energy Need
- age
- sex
- pregnancy
- activities

## Health Problems from Improper Diet
- under-nutrition
