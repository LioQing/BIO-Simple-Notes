## Structure of an Animal Cell
- Cell membrane
- Cytoplasm
- Nucleus
    - Nuclear membrane
    - Chromatin
- Rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER)
- Mitochondrion
- Vacuole
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER)

## Cell Membrane
Structure:
- Fluid mosaic model
- Phospholipid bilayer
    - Hydrophilic head (water loving)
    - Hydrophobic tail (water repelling)
- Mosaic pattern of protein
    - Carrier protein
    - Channel protein
    - Glycoprotein and glycolipid

Features:
- Selective permeable
    - non-polar part of phospholipid layer is permeable to lipid-soluble molecules only
    - channel proteins permit the passage of water molecules and ions and water-soluble substances
    - carrier proteins responsible for active transport
- Sites for binding certain proteins
    - inner membrane of mitochondria contains the electron transport chain for respiration
    - inner membrane of chloroplasts contain the elctron transport chain for photosynthesis
- Glycoproteins and glycolipids 
    - act as the recognition sites or receptor sites

## Cytoplasm
jelly-like substance  
many chemical reactions occur  
contains many organelles  

## Enoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
a network of membrane-bound tubes and sacs

- Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
    - covered with ribosomes
    - involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)
    - not covered with ribosomes
    - involved in the synthesis, storage and transport of lipids

## Mitochondrion
Structure:
- rod-shape structure
- hollow structure bound by a double membrane
    - outer membrane controls materials in and out of the organelle
    - inner membrane folded inward to form cristae
- central cavity are matrix that contains enzymes for Krebs cycle

Uses:
- for oxidative breakdown of food to release energy for the cell

## Nucleus
- Nuclear membrane
    - double membrane for contol of substance in and out
    - nuclear pores for transport of big molecules or particles
- Genetic material
    - netwrok of threads and granules - chromatin
    - during cell division, chromatins condenses into rod-like structures - chromosomes
    - Uses 
        - genes on chromosomes contains genetic info
        - chromosomes replicate to transmit the genetic info

## Plant Cells
Same as animal with extra organelles:
- Cell wall
- Chloroplasts
- Much larger vacuole

## Cell Wall
Components:
- mainly cellulose

Features:
- Fully permeable
- Very rigid - provide shape and mechanical support

</empty> | Cell membrane | Cell wall
---|---|---
Constituents | Phospholipids and proteins | Mainly cellulose
Strength | Weak and elastic | Strong and rigid
Permeability | Selectively permeable | Fully permeable
Thickness | Very thin | Very thick
Presesnt in | All living cells | In plant cells only

## Chloroplasts
- Double membrane
    - outer membrane - control the passage of substances into and out
    - inner membrane - extend inwards as thylakoid
