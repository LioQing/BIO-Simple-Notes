## Structure of an Animal Cell
- Cell membrane
- Cytoplasm
- Nucleus
    - Nuclear membrane
    - Chromatin
- Rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER)
- Mitochondrion
- Vacuole
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER)

## Cell Membrane
Structure:
- Fluid mosaic model
- Phospholipid bilayer
    - Hydrophilic head (water loving)
    - Hydrophobic tail (water repelling)
- Mosaic pattern of protein
    - Carrier protein
    - Channel protein
    - Glycoprotein and glycolipid

Features:
- Selective permeable
    - non-polar part of phospholipid layer is permeable to lipid-soluble molecules only
    - channel proteins permit the passage of water molecules and ions and water-soluble substances
    - carrier proteins responsible for active transport
- Sites for binding certain proteins
    - inner membrane of mitochondria contains the electron transport chain for respiration
    - inner membrane of chloroplasts contain the elctron transport chain for photosynthesis
- Glycoproteins and glycolipids 
    - act as the recognition sites or receptor sites

## Cytoplasm
jelly-like substance  
many chemical reactions occur  
contains many organelles
