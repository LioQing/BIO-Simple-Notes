- viruses
	- structure
		- **protein coat**
		- protein coat enclosing **nucleic acid**
		- protein coat may be covered by an **envelope**
		- protein coat or envelope attached with **suface proteins**  
	- reproduction
		- reproduce inside a host cell
		- takes over **enzymes machinery** of the host cell to produce new virus
	- harmful effects
		- bursting cell membrane of the host cell
		- inhibiting host cell to produce proteins or nucleic acids
	- examples of infectious diseases
		- Infleunza
		- Hepatitis B
		- Dengue fever
		- Zika fever
		- Japanese encephalitis
		- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
		- Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
		- Ebola
- bacteria
	- structure
		- prokaryotic
		- **cell wall**
		- cell wall enclosing **protoplast**
		- **no** true nucleus & membrane-bound organelles
	- reproduction
		- can reproduce inside or outside host cells
		- by **binary fission**
	- harmful effects & examples
		- **cholera** - produce toxins cuasing diarrhoea
		- **tuberculosis** - destroy alveoli causing difficult breathing
- protists
	- structure
		- unicellular, eukaryotic
	- harmful effect & example
		- **malaria** - attack & reproduce in liver cells, then reproduce in RBC & burst into other cells, toxins causes fever, shivering, sweating, **mosquitoes** transmit the disease to other person
- fungi
	- strcture
		- muticellular, eukaryotic
	- example:
		- athelete's foot

## Ways of Transmission
- droplets
	- examples
		- common cold
		- influenza
		- tuberculosis
		- measles
		- SARS
		- pneumonia
	- control methods
		- **cover mouth with tissue paper** when coughing or sneezing
		- wear a **surgical mask**
		- avoid **crowded places**
		- **wash hands** with soap or alcohol
- air
	- examples
		- tuberculosis
		- measles
	- control methods
		- keep **good ventilation**
		- same as droplets
- water or food
	- examples
		- by water
			- cholera
			- gastroenteritis
		- by food
			- cholera
			- food poisoning
			- gastroenteritis
	- control methods
		- treat **sweage** properly
		- keep **drinking water** clean & purify **fish tanks**
		- **wash hands** after using toilets, before preparing food & take meals
		- keep **utensils clean** for preparing food
		- cook food **thoroughly**
		- keep uneaten food in **refrigerators**
		- **separate raw & cooked food**
- body fluids
	- examples
		- by blood
			- hepatitis B
			- AIDS
		- by semen & vaginal fluid (sexually transmitted diseases STDs)
			- AIDS
			- syphilis
			- gonorrhoea
	- controlm ethods
		- by blood
			- cover wound with a dressing
			- wear **gloves**
			- **do not share** razers, tooth brush or injection needles
			- screen blood
			- **vaccination**
		- by STDs
			- use **condoms**
			- have only **one sexyal partner**
- vectors
	- examples
		- flies & cockroaches
			- cholera
			- typhoid
		- mosquitoes
			- malaria
			- dengue fever
			- Japanese encephalitis
			- Zika fever
	- control methods
		- flies & cockroaches
			- keep **houses clean**
			- cover **food** 
		- mosquitoes
			- destroy **breeding places of mosquitoes**
			- introduce fish into lakes, ponds, reservoirs to **feed on mosquito larvae**
			- kill adult mosquitoes with **insecticides**
			- prevent mosquitoes from reaching people (e.g. long-sleeves clothing, mosquito repellants, mosquito nets)
- direct contact
	- examples
		- athlete's foot
		- genital herpes
		- chickenpox
		- hand-foot-mouth disease
	- control methods
		- avoid physical contact & wear **protective clothing**
		- **wash hands** to remove pathogens
		- use **disinfectant** to clean contact surfaces
