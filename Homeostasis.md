## Homeostasis
keep internal env. of body stable for cells to function properly

parameters:  
- body temperature
	- for enzymes
	- skin is involved
	- thermoregulatory centre
- water content
	- water potential of tissue fluid
	- regulated by kidneys of the urinary system
	- osmoregulation
- gas content
	- for constant supply of oxygen for respiration of cells to supply snergy
	- CO2 released in respiration of cells to be removed to maintain pH
	- regulated by controlling breathing and heart beat
	- breathing system & circulatory system involved
- glucose level in blood
	- to provide sufficient glucose to cells for respiration
	- glucose is soluble, so it also helps maintain water potential
	- regulated by liver and pancreas

## Negative Feedback Mechanism
components:  
- receptor
	- sensory cell or organ
	- detect changes in the level of the parameter
- control centre
	- part of nervous system or hormonal system
	- process information and coordinate activites and response
- effector
	- receive instruction from control centre
	- produce response that has an opposite effect to original change

## Regulation of Glucose Level in Blood
key ([ higher than normal ]/[ lower than normal ])
1. **pancreas** contains chemoreceptors detects that blood glucose leve lis (higher/lower) than normal
2. hormone-secreting cells in pancreas are stimulated to secret (less/more) **insulin**
3. liver cells convert (more/less) glucose to glycogen to store in liver
	- in blood glucose lower than normal, **glycagon** is secreted to stimulate liver cells to convert glycogen to glucose
4. body cells uptake (more/less) glucose for oxidation
5. blood glucose level (drops/rises)

components in regulating blood glucose level
- receptors
	- chemoreceptors in pancreas
- control centre
	- pancreas acting as endocrine gland
- effectors
	- body cells
	- liver cells

## Diseases when Body Fails to Regulate Glucose Level
- lower than normal
	- hypoglucaemia
- higher than normal
	- diabetes mellitus
