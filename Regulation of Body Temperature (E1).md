## Importance of Body Temperature Regulation
- for enzymatic and metabolic activities
- keep stable at around 37°C

heat gain and heat loss:  
- radiation
	- heat gain by solar radiation
	- heat loss through infrared radiation from our body
- conduction
	- by transfering heat away to towards body by contacting
- convection
	- hot or cold air and fluid
- evaporation
	- heat loss through sweating
	- heat loss through respiration

## Structure and Function of Skin

<img src="https://github.com/LioQing/BIO-Simple-Notes/blob/master/images/temp%20regulation%20-%20-skin.png">

structure  
- epidermis
	- outermost layer
		- dry, dead, cornified cells
			- tough to protects inner tisures from mechanical injuries and invasion by germs
			- waterproof to reduce water loss by evaporation
		- will worn away
	- middle layer
		- living cells from the innermost layer to replace cell above
		- when pushed towards the surface, become flattened and cornified by filling with keratin
		- eventually die
	- innermost layer
		- actively dividing cells
			- contains dark pigment (melanin) to protects body from ultraviolet rays
			- dark pigment produces vitamin D under sunlight
			- produce new cells to replace for the loss in the outermost layer
			- form hair follicles and sweat glands
- dermis
	- sensory receptors
		- detect stimuli of hot, cold, touch, pressure, pain
		- send impulses to brain for giving sensation of temperature, pain, touch, pressure
	- hair follicle and hair
		- follicles are ingrowth of epidermis
	- erector muscles
		- when cold, contract to pull the hair upright to increase thickness of air among hair to reduce heat loss
		- when hot, relax to lie the hair flat to reduce air trapped in hair to promote heat loss
	- sweat gland
		- produce sweat to evaporate for heat loss
		- small amount of salts and urea are excreted
	- blood vessels and capillaries
		- supply nutrients and oxygen to the skin and remove metabolic wastes
		- through vasodilation and vasoconstriction to regulate amount of blood flowing near the surface to control heat loss
	- subaceous glands
		- produce oily substances called sebum
		- to make hair and skin water proof to reduce water loss
		- to make hair and skin supple to reduce breakage
		- it is an antiseptic that kills bacteria and fungi
- subcutaneous fat
	- insulating, to reduce heat loss
	- stores fat as food reserve

functions | means/structures | actions
--- | --- | ---
protection | barrier | avoid mechanical injury; prevent bacterial infection; reduce water loss; absorb harmful ultraviolet ray; shield tips of limbs by nails
temperature regulation | lose heat | increase sweating; increase blood flow into skin by vasodilation; trap less air by relaxing the erector muscles
temperature reguation | gain heat | reduce sweating; reduce blood flow into skin by vasoconstriction; trap more air by contacting the erector muscles; reduce heat loss by thick layer of subcutaneous fat
excretion | sweating | remove salts and urea
storage | subcutaneouse fat | store fat
perception | sensory receptors | receive stimuli from surroundings
synthesis | pigments in epidermis | produce vitamin D from sunlight

## Mechanisms of Regulating Body Temperature
key: ([ under cold conditions ]/[ under hot conditions ])

***physiological mechanisms***

**erector muscles and hair**  
1. erector muscles (contract/relax)
2. hairs (are pulled upright/lie flat)
3. traps (thicker/thinner) layer of air
4. air is a good insulator, it (reduces/promotes) heat loss by conduction, convection, radiation

**vasodilation/vasoconstriction**  
1. arterioles in the skin (constrict/dilate)
2. (less/more) blood flow to the capillaries near the skin surface
3. (less/more) heat loss from blood to the surroundings through conduction, convection, radiation

**sweating (promotes heat loss)**
1. sweat glands secret more sweat
2. evaporation of sweat cools the skin
3. more heat lost to produce the cooling effect

***structural mechanism***  

**thicker/thinner subcutaneous fat (long term)**
1. subcutaneous fat is good insulator of heat
2. (thickening/thinner) subcutaneous fat (promotes/reduces) insulating effect
3. (less/more) heat is lost

***other mechanisms***  

- under cold conditions
	- skeletal muscles contract rapidly and repeatedly - **shivering**
	- hormonal action - secretion of **thyroxine from thyroid glands** increases **metabolic rate** of body cells (long term)

***behavioral machanisms***  

under cold conditions | under hot conditions
--- | ---
put on more clothes | put on less clothes
curl the body to reduce S.A. exposing to cold air | go to shady place to reduce exposure to sunlight
turn on heaters to gain by radiation and convection | fan or air-conditioner to increase evaporation of sweat and by convection and radiation
take in more warm food and drinks | take in more cold food and drinks
do more exercises to produce heat |  

## Thermoregulatory Centre in the Hypothalamus
- have thermoreceptors to detect blood temperature
- receive nerve impulses from thermoreceptors in the skin to detect durrounding temperature
- heat gain centre
- heat loss centre  

## Heat Related Illness
- heat stroke
	- when body temperature is 41°C or higher for 10 to 15 mins
	- can cause death or permanent disability
	- occurs when sweating mechanism fails and body is unable to cool down
- hypothermia
	- when body temperature is below 35°C
	- can affects brain, make victim unable to think clearly or move well
	- when more heat is lost than the body can generate
