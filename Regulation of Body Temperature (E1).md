## Importance of Body Temperature Regulation
- for enzymatic and metabolic activities
- keep stable at around 37Â°C

heat gain and heat loss:  
- radiation
	- heat gain by solar radiation
	- heat loss through infrared radiation from our body
- conduction
	- by transfering heat away to towards body by contacting
- convection
	- hot or cold air and fluid
- evaporation
	- heat loss through sweating
	- heat loss through respiration

## Structure and Function of Skin

structure  
- epidermis
	- outermost layer
		- dry, dead, cornified cells
			- tough to protects inner tisures from mechanical injuries and invasion by germs
			- waterproof to reduce water loss by evaporation
		- will worn away
	- middle layer
		- living cells from the innermost layer to replace cell above
		- when pushed towards the surface, become flattened and cornified by filling with keratin
		- eventually die
	- innermost layer
		- actively dividing cells
			- contains dark pigment (melanin) to protects body from ultraviolet rays
			- dark pigment produces vitamin D under sunlight
			- produce new cells to replace for the loss in the outermost layer
			- form hair follicles and sweat glands
- dermis
	- sensory receptors
		- detect stimuli of hot, cold, touch, pressure, pain
		- send impulses to brain for giving sensation of temperature, pain, touch, pressure
	- hair follicle and hair
		- follicles are ingrowth of epidermis
	- erector muscles
		- when cold, contract to pull the hair upright to increase thickness of air among hair to reduce heat loss
		- when hot, relax to lie the hair flat to reduce air trapped in hair to promote heat loss
	- sweat gland
		- produce sweat to evaporate for heat loss
		- small amount of salts and urea are excreted
	- blood vessels and capillaries
		- supply nutrients and oxygen to the skin and remove metabolic wastes
		- through vasodilation and vasoconstriction to regulate amount of blood flowing near the surface to control heat loss
	- subaceous glands
		- produce oily substances called sebum
		- to make hair and skin water proof to reduce water loss
		- to make hair and skin supple to reduce breakage
		- it is an antiseptic that kills bacteria and fungi
- subcutaneous fat
	- insulating, to reduce heat loss
	- stores fat as food reserve
